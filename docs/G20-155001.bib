    abstract = "In this study, we begin a comprehensive characterisation of temperature extremes in Ireland for the period 1981-2010. We produce returnlevels of anomalies of daily maximum temperature extremes for an areaover Ireland, for the 30-year period 1981-2010. We employ extreme valuetheory (EVT) to model the data using the generalised Pareto distribution(GPD) as part of a three-level Bayesian hierarchical model. We use predictive processes in order to solve the computationally difficult problem ofmodelling data over a very dense spatial field. To our knowledge, this isthe first study to combine predictive processes and EVT in this manner.The model is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.Posterior parameter estimates and return level surfaces are produced, inaddition to specific site analysis at synoptic stations, including CasementAerodrome and Dublin Airport. Observational data from the period 2011-2018 is included in this site analysis to determine if there is evidence ofa change in the observed extremes. An increase in the frequency of extreme anomalies, but not the severity, is observed for this period. Wefound that the frequency of observed extreme anomalies from 2011-2018at the Casement Aerodrome and Phoenix Park synoptic stations exceedthe upper bounds of the credible intervals from the model by 20{\%} and 7{\%}respectively.",
