Studies indicated declining country food (CF) consumption in favour of market food (MF). Drivers of this transition include colonial processes, poverty and socio-economic factors, changing food preferences and knowledge, and climate change. Health implications of the dietary transition are complex. Micro-nutrient deficiencies and dietary inadequacy are serious concerns and likely exacerbated by increased consumption of non-nutrient dense MF. Food insecurity, overweight, obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes are growing public health concerns. Meanwhile, declining CF consumption is entangled with shifting culture and traditional knowledge, with potential implications for psychological, spiritual, social and cultural health and well-being.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}{\textless}/jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:sec id=``S1368980020002402{\_}as4''{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Conclusions:{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}By exploring and synthesising published literature, this review provides insight into the complex factors influencing Inuit diet and health.
