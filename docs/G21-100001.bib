Using ground observations, flux measurements, and remote sensing imagery, here we show that decline in winds significantly extended DFS over high latitudes at a magnitude comparable with the temperature and precipitation effects. We found that decline in winds reduces evapotranspiration, causes fewer damaging effects, and also results in decreased cooling effect. Our results therefore are of great significance for carbon cycle modeling because an improved algorithm based on these findings projected overall widespread earlier DFS by the end of this century, contributing potentially to a positive feedback to climate.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}",
