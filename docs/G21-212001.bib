    abstract = "Activated carbons have been widely used for water treatment due to their large surface area and structural stability. Their high cost has motivated the development of sustainable bio-based sorbents. However, their industrial acceptance within the water industry is limited by lower surface areas and poorer adsorptive capacities as compared with commercial sorbents. We herein report a green, high performance porous carbon produced from boreal peats for organic micropollutant removal. Boreal peatlands are increasingly damaged due to climate change-induced wildfires and droughts, which lead to increased run-off and impeded forest regrowth. Fire-impacted peatland soils therefore were excavated and converted into value-added porous carbons through ZnCl 2 activation at low temperature (400 {--} 600 {\mbox{$^\circ$}}C). These products have significantly higher surface areas ({\textgreater} 1377 m 2 /g) than commercial activated carbon Norit GSX (965 m 2 /g). Adsorption of p -nitrophenol, a micropollutant, onto the porous carbons is efficient, and superior to that of Norit GSX and most sorbents reported in the literature. Adsorption mainly occurred through multi-layer chemisorption and was impacted by the electron donor-acceptor complexes mechanism, {\mbox{$\pi$}}-{\mbox{$\pi$}} interactions and steric effects. Because of the massive environmental and economic benefits, peat porous carbons are strong candidates for use in large-scale water treatment facilities. {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Simple and rapid synthesis of highly porous carbons from damaged peatland soils. {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Peat porous carbons exhibit extraordinary removal for p -nitrophenol ({\textgreater} 530 mg/g). {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Maximum adsorption capacity substantially greater than literature values. {\mbox{$\bullet$}} Boreal peat porous carbons are eco-friendly high-performance bio-based sorbents for market use.",
