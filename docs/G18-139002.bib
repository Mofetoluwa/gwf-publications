    abstract = {Abstract. A physically based hydroclimatological model (AMUNDSEN) is used to assess future climate change impacts on the cryosphere and hydrology of the {\"O}tztal Alps (Austria) until 2100. The model is run in 100 m spatial and 3 h temporal resolution using in total 31 downscaled, bias-corrected, and temporally disaggregated EURO-CORDEX climate projections for the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios as forcing data, making this {--} to date {--} the most detailed study for this region in terms of process representation and range of considered climate projections. Changes in snow coverage, glacierization, and hydrological regimes are discussed both for a larger area encompassing the {\"O}tztal Alps (1850 km2, 862{--}3770 m a.s.l.) as well as for seven catchments in the area with varying size (11{--}165 km2) and glacierization (24{--}77 {\%}). Results show generally declining snow amounts with moderate decreases (0{--}20 {\%} depending on the emission scenario) of mean annual snow water equivalent in high elevations ({\textgreater} 2500 m a.s.l.) until the end of the century. The largest decreases, amounting to up to 25{--}80 {\%}, are projected to occur in elevations below 1500 m a.s.l. Glaciers in the region will continue to retreat strongly, leaving only 4{--}20 {\%} of the initial (as of 2006) ice volume left by 2100. Total and summer (JJA) runoff will change little during the early 21st century (2011{--}2040) with simulated decreases (compared to 1997{--}2006) of up to 11 {\%} (total) and 13 {\%} (summer) depending on catchment and scenario, whereas runoff volumes decrease by up to 39 {\%} (total) and 47 {\%} (summer) towards the end of the century (2071{--}2100), accompanied by a shift in peak flows from July towards June.},
