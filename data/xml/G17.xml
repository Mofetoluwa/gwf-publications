Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1‐ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand‐level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition – which is an indicator for the mass‐ratio theory – had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers. In sum, diversity and mass‐ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.</abstract><url hash="79856f28">2017.GWF-1.2</url><doi>10.1111/1365-2745.12756</doi><bibkey>T.

This coupling is nonlinear by nature and complicated in atmospheric flows where eddies of many sizes are superimposed. In mountainous terrain, wind flow descriptions are further complicated by topographically influenced or enhanced flows. To improve the current understanding and modeling of blowing snow transport in complex terrain, statistically significant timing and frequencies of wind–snow coupling were identified in high-frequency observations of surface blowing snow and near-surface turbulence from a mountain field site in the Canadian Rockies. Investigation of the mechanisms influencing near-surface, high-frequency turbulence and snow concentration fluctuations provided strong evidence for amplitude modulation from large-scale motions.

In high-latitude and high-altitude urban centers, snow management is one of the larger unknowns and has both operational and budgetary limitations. Snowfall and snow depth observations within urban environments are important to plan snow clearing and prepare for the effects of spring runoff on cities’ drainage systems. In-house research functions are expensive, but one way to overcome that expense and still produce effective data is through citizen science. In this paper, we examine the potential to use citizen science for snowfall data collection in urban environments.

The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) plays an important role in many terrain-related applications, particular in high northern latitudes where there is uncertainty in DEMs. Using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar techniques, this study examined how different RADARSAT-2 beam modes can be used to generate DEMs with high accuracy. Using a conventional interferometry method, the Spotlight DEM shows the highest accuracy among all studied DEM products, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 13.9 to 17.4 m, followed by the F0W3 DEM and U26W2 DEM. The error sources in DEM generation due to uncertainty in perpendicular baseline and atmospheric delay are likely more important than the random phase noise caused by volume scattering and environmental changes during synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. The small baselines subset (SBAS) method did not significantly improve DEM quality due to the limitation of the number of SAR images in this study. The integration of both Spotlight conventional DEMs and SBAS DEM considerably improved results yielding high-quality DEMs for the study area, with an RMSE of 9.7 m. Further studies are necessary to quantitatively evaluate the effects of surface motion as well as the orbital and atmospheric errors on the DEM accuracy. The Slave River Delta in the Northwest Territories of Canada was used as a test case.</abstract><url hash="ee57b6a0">2017.GWF-1.9</url><doi>10.1117/1.JRS.11.035013</doi><bibkey>Chu-etal-2017-RADARSAT-2-based</bibkey></paper><paper id="10"><title>A novel stochastic method for reconstructing daily precipitation times-series using tree-ring data from the western Canadian Boreal Forest</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Chun</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Mamet</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Metsaranta</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Barr</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract /><url hash="ea3aa177">2017.GWF-1.10</url><doi>10.1016/J.DENDRO.2017.01.003</doi><bibkey>Chun-etal-2017-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="11"><title>A modelling framework to simulate field‐scale nitrate response and transport during snowmelt: The WINTRA model</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Costa</last></author><author><first>Jennifer</first><last>Roste</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Modelling nutrient transport during snowmelt in cold regions remains a major scientific challenge.

The Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia is one of the largest and
most important watersheds in western North America, and home to a rich
diversity of biological species and economic assets that depend implicitly
upon its extensive riverine habitats. The hydrology of the FRB is dominated
by snow accumulation and melt processes, leading to a prominent annual peak
streamflow invariably occurring in May–July. Nevertheless, while annual peak
daily streamflow (APF) during the spring freshet in the FRB is historically
well correlated with basin-averaged, 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE),
there are numerous occurrences of anomalously large APF in below- or
near-normal SWE years, some of which have resulted in damaging floods in the
region. An imperfect understanding of which other climatic factors contribute
to these anomalously large APFs hinders robust projections of their magnitude
and frequency. We employ the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) process-based hydrological
model driven by gridded observations to investigate the key controlling
factors of anomalous APF events in the FRB and four of its subbasins that
contribute nearly 70 % of the annual flow at Fraser-Hope. The relative
influence of a set of predictors characterizing the interannual variability
of rainfall, snowfall, snowpack (characterized by the annual maximum value,
SWE max ), soil moisture and temperature on simulated APF at Hope
(the main outlet of the FRB) and at the subbasin outlets is examined within a
regression framework. The influence of large-scale climate modes of
variability (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the
El Nino–Southern Oscillation – ENSO) on APF magnitude is also assessed,
and placed in context with these more localized controls. The results
indicate that next to SWE max (univariate Spearman correlation
with APF of ρ ^ =  0.64; 0.70 (observations; VIC simulation)),
the snowmelt rate ( ρ ^ =  0.43 in VIC), the ENSO and PDO indices
( ρ ^ = − 0.40; − 0.41) and ( ρ ^ = − 0.35;
 − 0.38), respectively, and rate of warming subsequent to the date of
SWE max ( ρ ^ =  0.26; 0.38), are the most influential
predictors of APF magnitude in the FRB and its subbasins. The identification
of these controls on annual peak flows in the region may be of use in
understanding seasonal predictions or future projected streamflow changes.</abstract><url hash="0434c05b">2017.GWF-1.12</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-22-2285-2018</doi><bibkey>Curry-etal-2017-Examining</bibkey></paper><paper id="13"><title>Influence of snowpack and melt energy heterogeneity on snow cover depletion and snowmelt runoff simulation in a cold mountain environment</title><author><first>C.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7333f0cd">2017.GWF-1.13</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.07.051</doi><bibkey>DeBeer-etal-2017-Influence</bibkey></paper><paper id="14"><title>An Integrated Modelling System to Predict Hydrological Processes under Climate and Land-Use/Cover Change Scenarios</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Farjad</last></author><author><first>Anil</first><last>Gupta</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Faramarzi</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Marceau</last></author><abstract>This study proposes an integrated modeling system consisting of the physically-based MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model, a cellular automata model, and general circulation models (GCMs) scenarios to investigate the independent and combined effects of future climate and land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes on the hydrology of a river system. The integrated modelling system is applied to the Elbow River watershed in southern Alberta, Canada in conjunction with extreme GCM scenarios and two LULC change scenarios in the 2020s and 2050s. Results reveal that LULC change substantially modifies the river flow regime in the east sub-catchment, where rapid urbanization is occurring. It is also shown that the change in LULC causes an increase in peak flows in both the 2020s and 2050s. The impacts of climate and LULC change on streamflow are positively correlated in winter and spring, which intensifies their influence and leads to a significant rise in streamflow, and, subsequently, increases the vulnerability of the watershed to spring floods. This study highlights the importance of using an integrated modeling approach to investigate both the independent and combined impacts of climate and LULC changes on the future of hydrology to improve our understanding of how watersheds will respond to climate and LULC changes.</abstract><url hash="ed57656e">2017.GWF-1.14</url><doi>10.3390/W9100767</doi><bibkey>Farjad-etal-2017-An</bibkey></paper><paper id="15"><title>Parameter sensitivity analysis of a 1-D cold region lake model for land-surface schemes</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Guerrero</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Pernica</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Mackay</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Spence</last></author><abstract>Lakes might be sentinels of climate change, but the uncertainty in their main feedback to the atmosphere – heat-exchange fluxes – is often not considered within climate models. Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e. turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient ( K d ). A recently developed software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform Sensitivity Analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue – different parameter-values combinations yielding equivalent results – the answer to the question was unequivocal: K d , a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes and the uncertainty their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K d is determined. This is important since K d is seldom measured and accurate estimates of its value could reduce modeling uncertainty.</abstract><url hash="9a5055f8">2017.GWF-1.15</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-21-6345-2017</doi><bibkey>Guerrero-etal-2017-Parameter</bibkey></paper><paper id="16"><title>Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Haghnegahdar</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract /><url hash="03590442">2017.GWF-1.16</url><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.031</doi><bibkey>Haghnegahdar-etal-2017-Insights</bibkey></paper><paper id="17"><title>Multicriteria sensitivity analysis as a diagnostic tool for understanding model behaviour and characterizing model uncertainty</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Haghnegahdar</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>Fuad</first><last>Yassin</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>Complex hydrological models are being increasingly used nowadays for many purposes such as studying the impact of climate and land‐use change on water resources. However, building a high‐fidelity model, particularly at large scales, remains a challenging task, due to complexities in model functioning and behaviour and uncertainties in model structure, parameterization, and data. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA), which characterizes how the variation in the model response is attributed to variations in its input factors (e.g., parameters and forcing data), provides an opportunity to enhance the development and application of these complex models. In this paper, we advocate using GSA as an integral part of the modelling process by discussing its capabilities as a tool for diagnosing model structure and detecting potential defects, identifying influential factors, characterizing uncertainty, and selecting calibration parameters. Accordingly, we conduct a comprehensive GSA of a complex land surface–hydrology model, Modélisation Environmentale–Surface et Hydrologie (MESH), which combines the Canadian land surface scheme with a hydrological routing component, WATROUTE. Various GSA experiments are carried out using a new technique, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces, for alternative hydroclimatic conditions in Canada using multiple criteria, various model configurations, and a full set of model parameters. Results from this study reveal that, in addition to different hydroclimatic conditions and SA criteria, model configurations can also have a major impact on the assessment of sensitivity. GSA can identify aspects of the model internal functioning that are counter‐intuitive and thus help the modeller to diagnose possible model deficiencies and make recommendations for improving development and application of the model. As a specific outcome of this work, a list of the most influential parameters for the MESH model is developed. This list, along with some specific recommendations, is expected to assist the wide community of MESH and Canadian land surface scheme users, to enhance their modelling applications.</abstract><url hash="745e34d4">2017.GWF-1.17</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.11358</doi><bibkey>Haghnegahdar-etal-2017-Multicriteria</bibkey></paper><paper id="18"><title>Local‐Scale Advection of Sensible and Latent Heat During Snowmelt</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Harder</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><abstract>The breakup of snow cover into patches during snowmelt leads to a dynamic, heterogeneous land surface composed of melting snow, and wet and dry soil and plant surfaces. Energy exchange with the atmosphere is therefore complicated by horizontal gradients in surface temperature and humidity as snow surface temperature and humidity are regulated by the phase change of melting snow unlike snow‐free areas. Airflow across these surface transitions results in local‐scale advection of energy that has been documented as sensible heat during snowmelt, while latent heat advection has received scant attention. Herein, results are presented from an experiment measuring near‐surface profiles of air temperature and humidity across snow‐free to snow‐covered transitions that demonstrates that latent heat advection can be the same order of magnitude as sensible heat advection and is therefore an important source of snowmelt energy. Latent heat advection is conditional on an upwind source of water vapor from a wetted snow‐free surface.</abstract><url hash="e4e12945">2017.GWF-1.18</url><doi>10.1002/2017GL074394</doi><bibkey>Harder-etal-2017-Local‐Scale</bibkey></paper><paper id="19"><title>Influence of a rock glacier spring on the stream energy budget and cold‐water refuge in an alpine stream</title><author><first>Jordan</first><last>S.

Previous research has focused on the effects of distributed energy fluxes and meltwater from snowpacks and glaciers on the temperature of mountain streams. This study presents the effects of the groundwater spring discharge from an inactive rock glacier containing little ground ice on the temperature of an alpine stream. Rock glaciers are coarse blocky landforms that are ubiquitous in alpine environments and typically exhibit low groundwater discharge temperatures and resilience to climatic warming. Water temperature data indicate that the rock glacier spring cools the stream by an average of 3 °C during July and August and reduces maximum daily temperatures by an average of 5 °C during the peak temperature period of the first two weeks in August, producing a cold‐water refuge downstream of the spring. The distributed stream surface and streambed energy fluxes are calculated for the reach along the toe of the rock glacier, and solar radiation dominates the distributed stream energy budget. The lateral advective heat flux generated by the rock glacier spring is compared to the distributed energy fluxes over the study reach, and the spring advective heat flux is the dominant control on stream temperature at the reach scale. This study highlights the potential for coarse blocky landforms to generate climatically resilient cold‐water refuges in alpine streams.</abstract><url hash="93e619d3">2017.GWF-1.19</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.11391</doi><bibkey>S.

There, rising air temperatures could lead to warmer spring and longer growing seasons, changing landscape methane emissions. To quantify the effect of warmer spring conditions on methane emissions of a boreal peat landscape in the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, we analyzed four years (2013–2016) of methane fluxes measured with the eddy covariance technique and long-term (1951–2016) meteorological observations from a nearby climate station. In May, after snowmelt was complete, mean air temperatures were more than 2 °C warmer in 2013, 2015, and 2016 than in 2014. Mean growing season (May–August) air temperatures, in contrast, differed by less than 1 °C over the four years. Warmer May air temperatures caused earlier wetland soil warming, with temperatures rising from ~0 °C to &gt;12 °C 25 to 40 days earlier and leading to ~6 °C warmer mean soil temperatures between May and June. However, from July to August, soil temperatures were similar among years. Mean May to August and annual methane emissions (6.4 g CH4 m−2 and 9.4 g CH4 m−2, respectively) of years with warmer spring (i.e. May) temperatures exceeded emissions during the cooler year by 20%–30% (4.5 g CH4 m−2 and 7.2 g CH4 m−2, respectively). Among years with warmer springs, growing season methane emissions varied little (±0.5 g CH4 m−2). The observed interannual differences are most likely caused by a strong soil temperature control on methane fluxes and large soil temperature differences during the spring. Thus, in a warming climate, methane emissions from waterlogged boreal peat landscapes at the southern limit of permafrost are likely to increase in response to more frequent occurrences of warm springs.</abstract><url hash="c117f2b4">2017.GWF-1.20</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/aa8c85</doi><bibkey>Helbig-etal-2017-Warmer</bibkey></paper><paper id="21"><title>Mapping Canadian wildland fire interface areas</title><author><first>Lynn</first><last>M.

To mitigate WUI fires, basic information such as the location of interface areas is required, but such information is not available in Canada. Therefore, in this study, we produced the first national map of WUI in Canada. We also extended the WUI concept to address potentially vulnerable industrial structures and infrastructure that are not traditionally part of the WUI, resulting in two additional maps: a ‘wildland–industrial interface’ map (i.e. the interface of wildland fuels and industrial structures, denoted here as WUI-Ind) and a ‘wildland–infrastructure interface’ map (i.e. the interface of wildland fuels and infrastructure such as roads and railways, WUI-Inf). All three interface types (WUI, WUI-Ind, WUI-Inf) were defined as areas of wildland fuels within a variable-width buffer (maximum distance: 2400m) from potentially vulnerable structures or infrastructure. Canada has 32.3 million ha of WUI (3.8% of total national land area), 10.5 million ha of WUI-Ind (1.2%) and 109.8 million ha of WUI-Inf (13.0%).

The economic consequences for Egypt are especially substantial if the river basin countries pursue a unilateral irrigation development strategy. In order to prevent water use conflicts and ease water scarcity conditions, a cooperative water development strategy is needed as well as economic diversification in favor of less water-intensive sectors, combined with investments in water-saving infrastructure and improved irrigation efficiency.</abstract><url hash="2f199398">2017.GWF-1.22</url><doi>10.1142/S201000781750004X</doi><bibkey>Kahsay-etal-2017-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="23"><title>Characteristics, atmospheric drivers and occurrence patterns of freezing precipitation and ice pellets over the Prairie Provinces and Arctic Territories of Canada: 1964–2005</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Kochtubajda</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Mooney</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><abstract /><url hash="581ea30e">2017.GWF-1.23</url><doi>10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2017.03.005</doi><bibkey>Kochtubajda-etal-2017-Characteristics,</bibkey></paper><paper id="24"><title>Diagnosis of the hydrology of a small Arctic basin at the tundra-taiga transition using a physically based hydrological model</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Krogh</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><abstract /><url hash="c67a36ad">2017.GWF-1.24</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.05.042</doi><bibkey>Krogh-etal-2017-Diagnosis</bibkey></paper><paper id="25"><title>Recent Very Hot Summers in Northern Hemispheric Land Areas Measured by Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Will Be the Norm Within 20 Years</title><author><first>Chao</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Yuanyuan</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Michalak</last></author><abstract>Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) accounts for the effect of environmental temperature and humidity on thermal comfort, and can be directly related to the ability of the human body to dissipate excess metabolic heat and thus avoid heat stress. Using WBGT as a measure of environmental conditions conducive to heat stress, we show that anthropogenic influence has very substantially increased the likelihood of extreme high summer mean WBGT in northern hemispheric land areas relative to the climate that would have prevailed in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. We estimate that the likelihood of summer mean WGBT exceeding the observed historical record value has increased by a factor of at least 70 at regional scales due to anthropogenic influence on the climate. We further estimate that, in most northern hemispheric regions, these changes in the likelihood of extreme summer mean WBGT are roughly an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding changes in the likelihood of extreme hot summers as simply measured by surface air temperature. Projections of future summer mean WBGT under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario that are constrained by observations indicate that by 2030s at least 50% of the summers will have mean WBGT higher than the observed historical record value in all the analyzed regions, and that this frequency of occurrence will increase to 95% by mid‐century.</abstract><url hash="b17d063b">2017.GWF-1.25</url><doi>10.1002/2017EF000639</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2017-Recent</bibkey></paper><paper id="26"><title>Circulation characteristics of persistent cold spells in central–eastern North America</title><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Manson</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Meek</last></author><abstract /><url hash="28745781">2017.GWF-1.26</url><doi>10.1007/s13351-017-6146-y</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2017-Circulation</bibkey></paper><paper id="27"><title>On Compatible Triangulations with a Minimum Number of Steiner Points</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Lubiw</last></author><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><abstract /><url hash="5f736717">2017.GWF-1.27</url><doi>10.1016/J.TCS.2020.06.014</doi><bibkey>Lubiw-etal-2017-On</bibkey></paper><paper id="28"><title>Future changes to drought characteristics over the Canadian Prairie Provinces based on NARCCAP multi-RCM ensemble</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Masud</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khaliq</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract /><url hash="cfcc7a86">2017.GWF-1.28</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-016-3232-2</doi><bibkey>Masud-etal-2017-Future</bibkey></paper><paper id="29"><title>Projected changes to short- and long-duration precipitation extremes over the Canadian Prairie Provinces</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Masud</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khaliq</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b8cb4a10">2017.GWF-1.29</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-016-3404-0</doi><bibkey>Masud-etal-2017-Projected</bibkey></paper><paper id="30"><title>Impacts of wastewater treatment plant effluent on energetics and stress response of rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) in the Grand River watershed.</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Mehdi</last></author><author><first>Fiona</first><last>Dickson</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bragg</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Servos</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>M.

Extreme climatic events, such as droughts and heat stress, induce anomalies in ecosystem–atmosphere CO2 fluxes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), and, hence, can change the net ecosystem carbon balance. However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and Reco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted. Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, Reco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones. Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and Reco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of Reco over time turned from an initial increase to a downregulation after about 2 weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact. Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies but as a novelty generalizes these findings on the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land–atmosphere fluxes GPP and Reco can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.</abstract><url hash="af0bf363">2017.GWF-1.31</url><doi>10.5194/BG-15-1293-2018</doi><bibkey>Buttlar-etal-2017-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="32"><title>Peatland water repellency: Importance of soil water content, moss species, and burn severity</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Moore</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Lukenbach</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Kettridge</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Devito</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3602a2d9">2017.GWF-1.32</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.09.036</doi><bibkey>Moore-etal-2017-Peatland</bibkey></paper><paper id="33"><title>Assessment of nutrient loadings of a large multipurpose prairie reservoir</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4105924f">2017.GWF-1.33</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.04.043</doi><bibkey>Morales-Marín-etal-2017-Assessment</bibkey></paper><paper id="34"><title>Estimating Sediment Loadings in the South Saskatchewan River Catchment</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="df6107ec">2017.GWF-1.34</url><doi>10.1007/s11269-017-1838-8</doi><bibkey>Morales-Marín-etal-2017-Estimating</bibkey></paper><paper id="35"><title>Sediment phosphorus speciation and mobility under dynamic redox conditions</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Parsons</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Rezanezhad</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>O'Connell</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Cappellen</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment has caused phosphorus (P) accumulation in many freshwater sediments, raising concerns that internal loading from legacy P may delay the recovery of aquatic ecosystems suffering from eutrophication. Benthic recycling of P strongly depends on the redox regime within surficial sediment. In many shallow environments, redox conditions tend to be highly dynamic as a result of, among others, bioturbation by macrofauna, root activity, sediment resuspension and seasonal variations in bottom-water oxygen (O2) concentrations. To gain insight into the mobility and biogeochemistry of P under fluctuating redox conditions, a suspension of sediment from a hypereutrophic freshwater marsh was exposed to alternating 7-day periods of purging with air and nitrogen gas (N2), for a total duration of 74 days, in a bioreactor system. We present comprehensive data time series of bulk aqueous- and solid-phase chemistry, solid-phase phosphorus speciation and hydrolytic enzyme activities demonstrating the mass balanced redistribution of P in sediment during redox cycling. Aqueous phosphate concentrations remained low ( ∼  2.5 µM) under oxic conditions due to sorption to iron(III) oxyhydroxides. During anoxic periods, once nitrate was depleted, the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxyhydroxides released P. However, only 4.5 % of the released P accumulated in solution while the rest was redistributed between the MgCl2 and NaHCO3 extractable fractions of the solid phase. Thus, under the short redox fluctuations imposed in the experiments, P remobilization to the aqueous phase remained relatively limited. Orthophosphate predominated at all times during the experiment in both the solid and aqueous phase. Combined P monoesters and diesters accounted for between 9 and 16 % of sediment particulate P. Phosphatase activities up to 2.4 mmol h−1 kg−1 indicated the potential for rapid mineralization of organic P (Po), in particular during periods of aeration when the activity of phosphomonoesterases was 37 % higher than under N2 sparging. The results emphasize that the magnitude and timing of internal P loading during periods of anoxia are dependent on both P redistribution within sediments and bottom-water nitrate concentrations.</abstract><url hash="a866377a">2017.GWF-1.35</url><doi>10.5194/BG-14-3585-2017</doi><bibkey>Parsons-etal-2017-Sediment</bibkey></paper><paper id="36"><title>Transformation of snow isotopic signature along groundwater recharge pathways in the Canadian Prairies</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Pavlovskii</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Lennon</last></author><abstract /><url hash="316f66c0">2017.GWF-1.36</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.09.053</doi><bibkey>Pavlovskii-etal-2017-Transformation</bibkey></paper><paper id="37"><title>The significance of spatial variability of rainfall on simulated runoff: an evaluation based on the Upper Lee catchment, UK</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Pechlivanidis</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>McIntyre</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>The significance of spatial variability of rainfall on runoff is explored as a function of catchment scale and type, and antecedent conditions via the continuous time, semi-distributed probability distributed model (PDM) hydrological model applied to the Upper Lee catchment, UK. The impact of catchment scale and type is assessed using 11 nested catchments, and further assessed by artificially changing the catchment characteristics and translating these to model parameters (MPs) with uncertainty using model regionalisation. Dry and wet antecedent conditions are represented by ‘warming up’ the model under different rainfall time series. Synthetic rainfall events are introduced to directly relate the change in simulated runoff to the spatial variability of rainfall. Results show that runoff volume and peak are more sensitive to the spatial rainfall for more impermeable catchments; however, this sensitivity is significantly undermined under wet antecedent conditions. Although there is indication that the impact of spatial rainfall on runoff varies as a function of catchment scale, the variability of antecedent conditions between the synthetic catchments seems to mask this significance. Parameter uncertainty analysis highlights the importance of accurately representing the spatial variability of the catchment properties and their translation to MPs when investigating the effects of spatial properties of rainfall on runoff.</abstract><url hash="46685656">2017.GWF-1.37</url><doi>10.2166/NH.2016.038</doi><bibkey>Pechlivanidis-etal-2017-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="38"><title>Sediment plume model—a comparison between use of measured turbidity data and satellite images for model calibration</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Sadeghian</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hudson</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d6d74bc7">2017.GWF-1.38</url><doi>10.1007/s11356-017-9616-y</doi><bibkey>Sadeghian-etal-2017-Sediment</bibkey></paper><paper id="39"><title>On the appropriate definition of soil profile configuration and initial conditions for land surface–hydrology models in cold regions</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Sapriza-Azuri</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Gamazo</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Arctic and subarctic regions are amongst the most
susceptible regions on Earth to global warming and climate change.
Understanding and predicting the impact of climate change in these regions
require a proper process representation of the interactions between climate,
carbon cycle, and hydrology in Earth system models. This study focuses on
land surface models (LSMs) that represent the lower boundary condition of
general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs), which
simulate climate change evolution at the global and regional scales,
respectively. LSMs typically utilize a standard soil configuration with a
depth of no more than 4 m, whereas for cold, permafrost regions, field
experiments show that attention to deep soil profiles is needed to
understand and close the water and energy balances, which are tightly
coupled through the phase change. To address this gap, we design and run a
series of model experiments with a one-dimensional LSM, called CLASS
(Canadian Land Surface Scheme), as embedded in the MESH (Modélisation
Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology) modelling system, to
(1) characterize the effect of soil profile depth under different climate
conditions and in the presence of parameter uncertainty; (2) assess the
effect of including or excluding the geothermal flux in the LSM at the
bottom of the soil column; and (3) develop a methodology for temperature
profile initialization in permafrost regions, where the system has an
extended memory, by the use of paleo-records and bootstrapping. Our study
area is in Norman Wells, Northwest Territories of Canada, where measurements
of soil temperature profiles and historical reconstructed climate data are
available. Our results demonstrate a dominant role for parameter
uncertainty, that is often neglected in LSMs. Considering such high
sensitivity to parameter values and dependency on the climate condition, we
show that a minimum depth of 20 m is essential to adequately represent
the temperature dynamics. We further show that our proposed initialization
procedure is effective and robust to uncertainty in paleo-climate
reconstructions and that more than 300 years of reconstructed climate time
series are needed for proper model initialization.

Here we propose a novel partitioning‐focused calibration technique that utilizes flow‐partitioning coefficients developed based on the pioneering work of L'vovich (1979). Our hypothesis is that inclusion of the L'vovich partitioning relations in calibration increases model consistency and parameter identifiability and leads to superior model performance with respect to flow partitioning than using traditional hydrological signatures (e.g., flow duration curve indices) alone. The L'vovich approach partitions the annual precipitation into four components (quick flow, soil wetting, slow flow, and evapotranspiration) and has been shown to work across a range of climatic and landscape settings. A new diagnostic multicriteria model calibration methodology is proposed that first quantifies four calibration measures for watershed functions based on the L'vovich theory, and then utilizes them as calibration criteria. The proposed approach is compared with a traditional hydrologic signature‐based calibration for two conceptual bucket models. Results reveal that the proposed approach not only improves flow partitioning in the model compared to signature‐based calibration but is also capable of diagnosing flow‐partitioning inaccuracy and suggesting relevant model improvements. Furthermore, the proposed partitioning‐based calibration approach is shown to increase parameter identifiability. This model calibration approach can be readily applied to other models.</abstract><url hash="974d5532">2017.GWF-1.40</url><doi>10.1002/2016WR019736</doi><bibkey>Shafii-etal-2017-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="41"><title>Progressive Latin Hypercube Sampling: An efficient approach for robust sampling-based analysis of environmental models</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract /><url hash="e04a65a4">2017.GWF-1.41</url><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.010</doi><bibkey>Sheikholeslami-etal-2017-Progressive</bibkey></paper><paper id="42"><title>Improved Understanding of River Ice Processes Using Global Sensitivity Analysis Approaches</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>Fuad</first><last>Yassin</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract>AbstractThe high impact of river ice phenomena on the hydrology of cold regions has led to the extensive use of numerical models in simulating and predicting river ice processes.

The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has significantly modified hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, artificial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the first detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the first generation of largescale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human-water interface in hydrological models.</abstract><url hash="e727a1bd">2017.GWF-1.45</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-21-4169-2017</doi><bibkey>Wada-etal-2017-Human–water</bibkey></paper><paper id="46"><title>Assessing the quality of the streamflow record for a long-term reference hydrometric station: Bow River at Banff</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>The operational history of one of Canada’s longest operating hydrometric stations is reviewed in detail, including flood estimates that precede formal hydrometric monitoring. The assessment inspects the early and operational history, the published streamflow record and the stage-discharge measurements collected since 1909. Methods used to estimate pre-operational high flows and the operational history are reviewed to establish potential issues with changes in technology, location and measurement sections. The streamflow record is screened for discontinuities and change. The stage-discharge measurements used to establish the rating curve for open-water and ice-covered periods are assessed and used to establish the degree of support for the published data over the period of record. In the period 1882 to 1909, occasional high-stage estimates were used to estimate peak discharge, but with considerable uncertainty due to lack of stream velocity measurements and bed profiles. For the period 1909–1914 it is difficult to confirm the validity of the data as benchmarks and gauge corrections are unclear. Since 1922 when the station was established in its present location, many changes in the technology used for recording stage and measuring discharge have occurred. Rating curve support for high and low flows has varied over the period of record, particularly after cableway measurements of high flows were recently abandoned. Several important quality issues were identified that may require user caution, most notably an inconsistency with respect to the recording of winter ice-cover. These changes and issues have not affected the quality of the record in any substantial way. The stability of the flow control has remained remarkably consistent, resulting in high data quality for most of the period of record.</abstract><url hash="7e2ef007">2017.GWF-1.46</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2017.1399086</doi><bibkey>Whitfield-etal-2017-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="47"><title>Inter-comparison of daily precipitation products for large-scale hydro-climatic applications over Canada</title><author><first>Jefferson</first><last>S.

data sources are available that can potentially provide reliable estimates
of precipitation for climate and hydrological studies. However, research
into the consistency of these products for various regions has been limited
and in many cases non-existent. This study inter-compares several gridded
precipitation products over 15 terrestrial ecozones in Canada for different
seasons. The spatial and temporal variability of the errors (relative to
station observations) was quantified over the period of 1979 to 2012 at a
0.5° and daily spatio-temporal resolution. These datasets
were assessed in their ability to represent the daily variability of
precipitation amounts by four performance measures: percentage of bias,
root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation
ratio. Results showed that most of the datasets were relatively skilful in
central Canada. However, they tended to overestimate precipitation amounts
in the west and underestimate in the north and east, with the
underestimation being particularly dominant in northern Canada (above
60° N). The global product by WATCH Forcing Data
ERA-Interim (WFDEI) augmented by Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
(GPCC) data (WFDEI [GPCC]) performed best with respect to different metrics.
The Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) product performed comparably with
WFDEI [GPCC]; however, it only provides data starting in 2002. All the
datasets performed best in summer, followed by autumn, spring, and winter in
order of decreasing quality. Findings from this study can provide guidance
to potential users regarding the performance of different precipitation
products for a range of geographical regions and time periods.</abstract><url hash="0929c091">2017.GWF-1.47</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-21-2163-2017</doi><bibkey>S.

However, complex models, for example, the so‐called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high‐fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow‐based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land‐surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction. The framework effectively constrains the model behaviour (by constraining posterior parameter space) and results in more credible representation of hydrology across the watershed.</abstract><url hash="9996dd00">2017.GWF-1.48</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.11267</doi><bibkey>Yassin-etal-2017-Enhanced</bibkey></paper><paper id="49"><title>Evaluation of gridded precipitation data in the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya mountainous area</title><author><first>Shakir</first><last>Hussain</last></author><author><first>Xianfang</first><last>Song</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ren</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Hussain</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Han</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Zaman</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT The accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial for hydrological studies. This is especially true for the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya (HKKH) mountain region, which is characterized by high spatiotemporal precipitation variability. The paucity of raingauges makes it difficult to measure precipitation in this region precisely. We conducted evaluation of TMPA 3B42V7 and APHRO 1101 in the HKKH area on a daily basis at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, using 27 raingauges. Statistically, the largest error in the gridded data arose mainly from elevation, followed by volumetric error and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency. Overall, the TMPA data have a poor correlation with ground observations in the HKKH area, especially for higher altitudes. The western areas are relatively more underestimated and the Karakoram shows higher frequency of bias in the TMPA retrievals. This method could help improve the satellite precipitation estimation algorithm as it considers local physiography and climatic factors.</abstract><url hash="ee91ed96">2017.GWF-1.49</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2017.1384548</doi><bibkey>Hussain-etal-2017-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="50"><title>Flowering of the Cover Crop Sunn Hemp, Crotalaria juncea L.</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Meagher</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Nagoshi</last></author><author><first>James</first><last>T.

Sunn hemp flowers may also provide nectar and pollen for pollinators and enhance biological control by furnishing habitat for natural enemies. Despite these benefits, adoption in the United States has been limited because of restricted availability of seeds, particularly in temperate climates. Experiments were conducted in north-central Florida to compare flowering and seed production of domestic and foreign sunn hemp lines across different seeding rates and planting dates. Our objectives were to test whether a low seeding rate would result in the production of higher numbers of flowers and to test whether planting earlier in the season would also result in higher numbers of flowers. Our results over a 2 year period showed that the domestic cultivar AU Golden is capable of substantial flowering and seed production in the test region, confirming the compatibility of local environmental conditions. Seed costs suggest that ‘AU Golden’ is comparable with sunn hemp lines grown in foreign countries and is much less expensive than the standard cultivar Tropic Sun from Hawaii. The results demonstrate the potential economic viability of early flowering cultivars of sunn hemp as a cover crop alternative in Florida to improve soils in agricultural landscapes. Sunn hemp, Crotalaria juncea L., is a warm-season legume that is planted before or after a vegetable cash crop to add nutrients and organic matter to the soil (Cherr et al., 2006, 2007; Mansoer et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2005). This cover crop provides other benefits to growers such as suppression of weeds (Adler and Chase, 2007; Cho et al., 2015; Collins et al., 2008; Javaid et al., 2015; Morris et al., 2015; Mosjidis and Wehtje, 2011) and suppression of plant-parasitic nematode populations by not providing resources (Bhan et al., 2010; Braz et al., 2016). Sunn hemp is available to growers in northern Florida, where 10,000 ha of vegetables (potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L., and cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) are annually produced (Elwakil and Mossler, 2016; USDA-NASS, 2014). A major advantage of sunn hemp over many cover crops, particularly sorghumsudangrass (SSG) [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], is that it is a poor host for fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)] and other important moth pests (Meagher et al., 2004). Southern Florida is a major overwintering region for fall armyworm populations that annually migrate northward and infest corn acreages along the eastern United States. Sorghumsudangrass is one of the common cover crop and forage grasses in the United States and therefore is a likely source of fall armyworm populations (Meagher et al., 2004; Pair and Westbrook, 1995). Therefore, large scale replacement of SSG with sunn hemp in Florida could mitigate fall armyworm populations before and during these annual migrations on an area-wide scale. Another ecological service that cover crops can provide is flowers that provision pollinators and enhance biological control (Campbell et al., 2016). Studies have shown that early season flowering by cover crops can increase pollinator populations, which promote late-season pollination in cash crops (Riedinger et al., 2014). Flower density and the richness of the cover crop plants have the most direct influence on bee visitation and native bee abundance (Ellis and Barbercheck, 2015; Saunders et al., 2013). The first sunn hemp cultivar commercialized in the United States was ‘Tropic Sun’, which was a direct increase of the original seed purchased in 1958 from the island of Kauai, HI and developed by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) as a cooperative release in 1983 (Rotar and Joy, 1983; later identified as developed from PI 468956, Wang et al., 2006). Seed production in the tropics is good; however, because of this cultivar’s flowering response to short days, seed production is generally poor in the continental United States (Mosjidis, 2007; White and Haun, 1965). Therefore, seed availability to growers was limited to importation of ‘Tropic Sun’ from Hawaii or bringing in other germplasm from Brazil, India, South Africa, or other foreign locations. A breeding program to increase flowering and seed production was initiated at Auburn University in 2002. ‘AU Golden’ was developed from accession PI 322377, which was obtained from the National Plant Germplasm System. In a patent application, this germplasm was shown to be able to produce seed in Alabama, with the data extrapolated to indicate flower production, seed production, or both in the region between 40 north and 40 south latitude, and at least 400 lbs seed per acre when grown between 28 north and 28 south latitude (Mosjidis, 2014). These characteristics make it a potentially useful cover crop for much of Florida, which lies between 25 and 31 north latitude. However, it is not clear whether the local environment, including such factors as soil type, disease, herbivores, and appropriate pollinators, is conducive to this line of sunn hemp. To examine the potential and optimize sunn hemp cover crop usage in north-central Florida, multiple sunn hemp lines were tested in field studies to compare flowering and seed production across different seeding rates and planting dates. One objective was to test whether a low seeding rate would result in the production of higher numbers of flowers and seed pods. A second objective was to test whether planting ‘AU Golden’ earlier in the Received for publication 31 Mar. 2017. Accepted for publication 18 May 2017.

A final goal was to test whether similar sunn hemp seeding could be obtained but with the potential for higher overall biomass per acre if a mixture of sunn hemp and SSG was used as a cover crop. Materials and Methods Sunn hemp germplasm. Four different sunn hemp lines were used in the experiments. The two lines from the United States were ‘Tropic Sun’, purchased Mar. 2014 from Molokai Seed Co., Kaunakakai, HI, and ‘AU Golden’, purchased Mar. 2014 and Apr. 2015 from Petcher Seeds, Fruitdale, AL. The two foreign lines were Tillage Sunn (purchased Mar. 2014 from Hancock Seed Co., Dade City, FL), a brand of sunn hemp from India which is sold through several seed distributors, and an unknown germplasm (variety not stated) from South Africa (purchased Mar. 2011 from Petcher Seeds). 2014 trial. The experiment in 2014 was designed to compare flowering and seed production of four sunn hemp lines planted at three different seeding rates. Plots were arranged as a randomized complete block with three blocks, yielding 12 plots per block and a total of 36 plots. Sunn hemp plots were planted 23 Apr. 2014 at the University of Florida Plant Science Research and Education Unit, Citra, FL (29 24#42$N, 82 06#36$W). Seed densities were designed to replicate a low seeding rate for seed production (11.2 kg/ha = 10 lbs/acre), a high seeding rate for use as a cover crop (44.8 kg/ ha = 40 lbs/acre), and a medium seeding rate (28.0 kg/ha = 25 lbs/acre) (Cho et al., 2015). Each plot was 3.66 m · 7.62 m, with a 1.83-m unplanted border between plots. The 3 blocks were separated by 3.66 m. Sunn hemp seed was mixed with a cowpea-type Rhizobium inoculum before planting and was broadcast by hand and then covered manually with rakes. Plots were irrigated with overhead irrigation throughout the season and a temperature monitoring system was located at the experiment station (Florida Automated Weather Network, University of Florida IFAS Extension, http://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu/). Temperatures averaged 23.7 C from March through September. 2015 trial. The experiment in 2015 was also conducted at Citra, FL. Of the four lines evaluated in 2014, only ‘AU Golden’ appeared capable of producing mature seed under north Florida conditions. Therefore, the 2015 trial was designed to compare seed production of ‘AU Golden’ when planted at three different times during the season and at two seeding rates. For growers wanting to use sunn hemp strictly as a cover crop and to obtain more plant biomass per area with the same amount of sunn hemp seed, SSG was added to the high and low seeding rates. Plots were planted on 27 Apr., 26 June, and 26 Aug. The randomized complete block experimental design contained three blocks and four treatments, sunn hemp at 11.2 kg/ha (SH11), at 44.8 kg/ha (SH44), at 11.2 kg/ha plus SSG at 22.4 kg/ha (SH11SSG), and at 44.8 kg/ha plus SSG at 22.4 kg/ha (SH44SSG). Each plot measured 7.6 m · 33.8 m, with 0.3 m between plots. Sunn hemp seed was mixed with a cowpea-type Rhizobium inoculum before planting and was broadcast by hand and then covered by a roller.

NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission, launched in January 2015, provides global retrievals of FT state every two to three days. Validating SMAP FT observations with in-situ observations is difficult due to the substantial scale mismatch between a point estimate and a satellite footprint, inducing “representativeness errors” in the in-situ observations. Triple collocation (TC) is a validation technique that addresses this problem by combining estimates from in-situ, model and spaceborne estimates to obtain error estimates for all three products, without assuming that any product is error-free. Unfortunately, it fails when applied to binary or categorical variables, such as landscape FT state. In this study, we use a new variant of TC — categorical triple collocation (CTC) — that can be applied to binary variables, to validate the SMAP FT product across northern land regions (&gt;45N).</abstract><url hash="6058055f">2017.GWF-1.52</url><doi>10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127277</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2017-Validation</bibkey></paper><paper id="53"><title>Radar Remote Sensing of Agricultural Canopies: A Review</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Steele‐Dunne</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Mcnairn</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Monsiváis-Huertero</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Judge</last></author><author><first>Pang-Wei</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Papathanassiou</last></author><abstract>Observations from spaceborne radar contain considerable information about vegetation dynamics. The ability to extract this information could lead to improved soil moisture retrievals and the increased capacity to monitor vegetation phenology and water stress using radar data. The purpose of this review paper is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge with respect to backscatter from vegetated (agricultural) landscapes and to identify opportunities and challenges in this domain. Much of our understanding of vegetation backscatter from agricultural canopies stems from SAR studies to perform field-scale classification and monitoring. Hence, SAR applications, theory, and applications are considered here too. An overview will be provided of the knowledge generated from ground-based and airborne experimental campaigns that contributed to the development of crop classification, crop monitoring, and soil moisture monitoring applications. A description of the current vegetation modeling approaches will be given. A review of current applications of spaceborne radar will be used to illustrate the current state of the art in terms of data utilization. Finally, emerging applications, opportunities and challenges will be identified and discussed. Improved representation of vegetation phenology and water dynamics will be identified as essential to improve soil moisture retrievals, crop monitoring, and for the development of emerging drought/water stress applications.</abstract><url hash="175f35c9">2017.GWF-1.53</url><doi>10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2639043</doi><bibkey>Steele‐Dunne-etal-2017-Radar</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
