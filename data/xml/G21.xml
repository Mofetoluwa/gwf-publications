Consequently, inconsistencies arise between WUE calculations due to complex physical and physiological interactions. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare WUE estimates (harvest or flux-based) for alfalfa (C3 plant) and maize (C4 plant) and determine effects of input variables, plant physiology and farming practices on estimates. Four WUE calculations were investigated: two “harvest-based” methods, using above ground carbon content and either precipitation or evapotranspiration (ET), and two “flux-based” methods, using gross primary productivity (GPP) and either ET or transpiration. WUE estimates differed based on method used at both half-hourly and seasonal scales. Input variables used in calculations affected WUE estimates, and plant physiology led to different responses in carbon assimilation and water use variables. WUE estimates were also impacted by different plant physiological responses and processing methods, even when the same carbon assimilation and water use variables were considered. This study highlights a need to develop a metric of measuring cropland carbon-water coupling that accounts for all water use components, plant carbon responses, and biomass production.</abstract><url hash="78a1fc1b">2021.GWF-1.1</url><doi>10.3390/agriculture11080739</doi><bibkey>De Haan-etal-2021-Assessment</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Temporal variability in water and nutrient movement through vertisols into agricultural tile drains in the northern Great Plains</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Kokulan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>A.

Given ongoing environmental and political concerns related to the eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg in Canada and the potential for tile drains to transport significant quantities of nutrients from agricultural fields, an improved understanding of nutrient dynamics in tile drains in this region is needed. This study characterized seasonal patterns in tile flow and chemistry under variable hydroclimatic conditions and related this variance to temporal variability in soil hydraulic properties in a farm in southern Manitoba, Canada, from 2015 to 2017. Tile flow, soil hydraulic properties, and groundwater table position all varied seasonally, as did the chemistry of tile drain effluent. The majority of annual tile discharge, which occurred in late spring, appears to have been contributed by shallow groundwater, primarily through soil matrix pathways. At these greater tile flow rates, concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) were low (&lt;0.03 mg L–1 SRP, &lt;0.04 mg L–1 TP), but concentrations of nitrate (NO3-N) were high (20 to 25 mg L–1 NO3-N). In contrast, tile flows outside of this peak period appeared to be primarily attributed to preferential flow pathways through frozen (snowmelt) and dry soil cracks (summer). Phosphorus (P) concentrations were greater during snowmelt and summer (~0.05 mg L–1 SRP, ~0.1 mg L–1 TP) but did not produce significant nutrient loads due to the minimal tile discharge rates (&lt;1 mm d–1). This work suggests that the expansion of tile drainage may not exacerbate water quality issues involving P in the northern Great Plains but may increase nitrogen (N) loads in local water bodies.</abstract><url hash="e1a8ada1">2021.GWF-1.2</url><doi>10.2489/jswc.2021.00099</doi><bibkey>Kokulan-etal-2021-Temporal</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Assessment of effective LAI and water use efficiency using Eddy Covariance data.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Kompanizare</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>De Haan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khomik</last></author><abstract /><url hash="96af9d37">2021.GWF-1.3</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149628</doi><bibkey>Kompanizare-etal-2021-Assessment</bibkey></paper><paper id="4"><title>Phosphorus runoff from Canadian agricultural land: A dataset for 30 experimental fields</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><abstract /><url hash="08cb0894">2021.GWF-1.4</url><doi>10.1016/j.dib.2021.107405</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2021-Phosphorus</bibkey></paper><paper id="5"><title>Phosphorus runoff from Canadian agricultural land: A cross-region synthesis of edge-of-field results</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7fcc3802">2021.GWF-1.5</url><doi>10.1016/J.AGWAT.2021.107030</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2021-Phosphorus1</bibkey></paper><paper id="6"><title>..One size does not fit all: towards regional conservation practice guidance to reduce phosphorus loss risk in the lake erie watershed.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Jarvie</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Gunn</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Reid</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Joosse</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>King</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kleinman</last></author><author><first>Douglas</first><last>R Smith</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Zwonitzer</last></author><abstract>Agricultural phosphorus losses to surface water bodies remain a global eutrophication concern, despite the application of conservation practices on farm fields. Although it is generally agreed upon that the use of multiple conservation practices ("stacking") will lead to greater improvements to water quality, this may not be cost-effective to farmers, reducing the likelihood of adoption. At present, wholesale recommendations of conservation practices are given; however, the application of specific conservation practices in certain environments (e.g. no-till with surface application, cover crops) may not be effective and can even lead to unintended consequences. In this paper, we present the Lake Erie watershed as a case study that contains regions with unique physical geographies that include differences in climate, soil, topography and land use, which have implications for both phosphorus transport from agricultural fields and the efficacy of conservation practices in mitigating phosphorus losses. We define major regions within the Lake Erie watershed where common strategies for conservation practice implementation are appropriate and we propose a 5-step plan for bringing regionally-tailored, adaptive and cost-conscious conservation practice into watershed planning. Although this paper is specific to the Lake Erie watershed, our framework can be transferred across broader geographic regions to provide guidance for watershed planning.

Both CTL and PGW simulations were bias‐corrected to the GEM‐CaPA dataset using a multivariate quantile mapping method. An evaluation of the CTL simulation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation during the growing season against the gridded observations has been performed, indicating good agreements in the spatial patterns of air temperature and precipitation in western Canada. The PGW − CTL differences in several selected agroclimatic indices were then examined. Due to rising temperatures, substantial increases in growing degree‐days (GDD) by 800–1,200° days and reductions in frost days by 10 to 20 days, favouring regional crop production, are found in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. However, global warming also poses great risks to Canadian agriculture by modifying heat accumulations and water availability during the growing season. Plant heat stress will substantially increase by ∼50° days in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, offsetting the positive effects caused by the reduction in frost days and increase in GDD. The southern Canadian Prairies will experience statistically significant increases in the number of dry days and precipitation deficit, suggesting an exacerbation of water stress on the Canadian Prairies by global warming.</abstract><url hash="017d44bf">2021.GWF-1.8</url><doi>10.1002/qj.4188</doi><bibkey>Yao Kuma Agyeman-etal-2021-Modelled</bibkey></paper><paper id="9"><title>PEAT SURFACE COMPRESSION REDUCES SMOULDERING FIRE POTENTIAL AS A NOVEL FUEL TREATMENT FOR BOREAL PEATLANDS</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Deane</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Wilkinson</last></author><author><first>Gregory</first><last>J.

Proactive management strategies, such as fuel modification treatments, are necessary to reduce fire danger at the wildland-human interface (WHI). Novel approaches to fuel management are especially needed in peatlands where deep smouldering combustion is a challenge to suppression efforts and releases harmful emissions. Here, we integrate surface compression within conventional stand treatments to examine the potential for reducing smouldering of near-surface moss and peat. A linear model (adj. R2=0.62, p=2.2e-16) revealed that ground cover (F(2,101)=60.97, p&lt;0.001) and compression (F(1,101)=56.46, p&lt;0.001) had the greatest effects on smouldering potential, while stand treatment did not have a significant effect (F(3,101)=0.44, p=0.727). On average, compressed Sphagnum and feather moss plots showed 57.1% and 58.7% lower smouldering potential, respectively, when compared to uncompressed analogs. While practical evaluation is warranted to better understand the evolving effectiveness of this strategy, these findings demonstrate that a compression treatment can be successfully incorporated within both managed and unmanaged peatlands to reduce fire danger at the WHI.</abstract><url hash="767a7429">2021.GWF-1.9</url><doi>10.1139/cjfr-2021-0183</doi><bibkey>Deane-etal-2021-PEAT</bibkey></paper><paper id="10"><title>Ecohydrological trade-offs from multiple peatland disturbances: The interactive effects of drainage, harvesting, restoration and wildfire in a southern Ontario bog</title><author><first>C.</first><last>McCarter</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Wilkinson</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Moore</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7ec6b731">2021.GWF-1.10</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2021.126793</doi><bibkey>McCarter-etal-2021-Ecohydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="11"><title>Scientists' warning on extreme wildfire risks to water supply</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Robinne</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Hallema</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Bladon</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Flannigan</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Boisramé</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Bréthaut</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Doerr</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>di Baldassarre</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Gallagher</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Hohner</last></author><author><first>Stuart</first><last>J.

California experienced its three largest fires early in its fire season. The Pantanal, the largest wetland on the planet, burned over 20% of its surface. More than 18 million hectares of forest and bushland burned during the 2019–2020 fire season in Australia, killing 33 people, destroying nearly 2500 homes, and endangering many endemic species. The direct cost of damages is being counted in dozens of billion dollars, but the indirect costs on water‐related ecosystem services and benefits could be equally expensive, with impacts lasting for decades. In Australia, the extreme precipitation (“200 mm day −1 in several location”) that interrupted the catastrophic wildfire season triggered a series of watershed effects from headwaters to areas downstream. The increased runoff and erosion from burned areas disrupted water supplies in several locations. These post‐fire watershed hazards via source water contamination, flash floods, and mudslides can represent substantial, systemic long‐term risks to drinking water production, aquatic life, and socio‐economic activity. Scenarios similar to the recent event in Australia are now predicted to unfold in the Western USA. This is a new reality that societies will have to live with as uncharted fire activity, water crises, and widespread human footprint collide all‐around of the world. Therefore, we advocate for a more proactive approach to wildfire‐watershed risk governance in an effort to advance and protect water security. We also argue that there is no easy solution to reducing this risk and that investments in both green (i.e., natural) and grey (i.e., built) infrastructure will be necessary. Further, we propose strategies to combine modern data analytics with existing tools for use by water and land managers worldwide to leverage several decades worth of data and knowledge on post‐fire hydrology.</abstract><url hash="09c187a7">2021.GWF-1.11</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14086</doi><bibkey>Robinne-etal-2021-Scientists'</bibkey></paper><paper id="12"><title>Mapping smouldering fire potential in boreal peatlands and assessing interactions with the wildland–human interface in Alberta, Canada</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Wilkinson</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Furukawa</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>M.

The lack of smouldering fire risk assessment is a critical research gap as these fires can represent heavy resource draws and are predominant sources of smoke, air pollutants and atmospheric carbon. Here, for the first time, we combine existing knowledge of the controls on smouldering peat fire with expert opinion-based weightings through a multi-criteria decision analysis, to map the smouldering fire potential (i.e. hazard) of treed peatlands in the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada. We find that smouldering potential varies considerably between treed peatlands and that areas of sparser peatland coverage may contain high smouldering-potential peatlands. Further, we find that treed peatlands are a common feature in the wildland–human interface and that proportionally, the area of high smouldering potential is greater closer to roads compared with farther away. Our approach enables a quantitative measure of smouldering fire potential and evidences the need to incorporate peatland–wildfire interactions into wildfire management operations. We suggest that similar frameworks could be used in other peatland dominated regions as part of smouldering fire risk assessments.</abstract><url hash="90c8d61d">2021.GWF-1.12</url><doi>10.1071/WF21001</doi><bibkey>Wilkinson-etal-2021-Mapping</bibkey></paper><paper id="13"><title>The Use of Mobile Applications to Support Indigenous Youth Wellbeing in Canada</title><author><first>Noella</first><last>Noronha</last></author><author><first>Savanah</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Dawn</first><last>Martin Hill</last></author><author><first>Lori</first><last>Davis Hill</last></author><author><first>Sara</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Amy</first><last>General</last></author><author><first>Cynthia</first><last>McQueen</last></author><author><first>Makaśa</first><last>Looking Horse</last></author><author><first>Alexander</first><last>Drossos</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Lokker</last></author><author><first>Nicole</first><last>M.

As people of the land, all disruptions to ecological health are a disruption to personal and community holistic health. Land-based activities and cultural continuity strengthen pathways of perseverance for Indigenous youth (Toombs et al., 2016). For youth, cultural self-expression and personal agency are enhanced with digital platforms, which are well-suited to Indigenous people’s strengths in art, music, and oral forms of passing on knowledge. The field of mental health has turned to e-supports such as mobile applications (apps) that can provide easy-to-access intervention, when needed. To date, resilience interventions have received comparatively less attention than the study of resilience factors and processes. It is timely to review the extant literature on mental health apps with Indigenous youth as, currently, Indigenous apps are in early research stages. Critically reviewing work to date, it is argued that an inclusive and expansive concept of resilience, coherent with Indigenous holistic health views, is well-positioned as a foundation for collaborative resilience app development. To date, few mental health apps have been researched with Indigenous youth, and fewer have been co-constructed with Indigenous youth and their community members. The current literature points to feasibility in terms of readiness or potential usage, and functionality for promoting an integrated cultural and holistic health lens. As this effort may be specific to a particular Indigenous nation’s values, stories, and practices, we highlight the Haudenosaunee conceptual wellness model as one example to guide Indigenous and non-Indigenous science integration, with a current project underway with the JoyPopTM mHealth app for promoting positive mental health and resilience.</abstract><url hash="e7cfe68b">2021.GWF-1.13</url><doi>10.7202/1077724AR</doi><bibkey>Noronha-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="14"><title>Putting Table Cartograms into Practice</title><author><first>M</first><last>Zahid Hasan</last></author><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>Jarin</first><last>Tasnim</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

The densely populated Lake Erie watershed studied here is an important international lake that has experienced recent flooding and shoreline erosion alongside excessive nutrient loads that have contributed to lake eutrophication. Understanding the sources and pathways of flows is critical to solve the complex issues facing this watershed. Seventeen hydrologic and land-surface models of different complexity are set up over this domain using the same meteorological forcings, and their simulated streamflows at 46 calibration and seven independent validation stations are compared. Results show that: (1) the good performance of Machine Learning models during calibration decreases significantly in validation due to the limited amount of training data; (2) models calibrated at individual stations perform equally well in validation; and (3) most distributed models calibrated over the entire domain have problems in simulating urban areas but outperform the other models in validation.</abstract><url hash="0eac43be">2021.GWF-1.15</url><doi>10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0002097</doi><bibkey>Mai-etal-2021-Great</bibkey></paper><paper id="16"><title>A Testing Approach While Re-engineering Legacy Systems: An Industrial Case Study</title><author><first>Hamid</first><last>Khodabandehloo</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

However, these legacy systems answer the past requirements but are difficult to maintain and evolve due to old technology use.

Although the renovation process is a more affordable choice over redevelopment, it comes with its risks such as performance loss and failure to obtain quality goals. A proper test process can minimize risks incorporated with the renovation process. This work introduces a testing model tailored for the migration and re-engineering process and employs test automation, which results in early bug detection.

Development teams aiming to review architectural aspects (design) of a change commit consider many essential scenarios such as access rules and restrictions on usage of program entities across modules. Moreover, design review is essential when proper architectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system. Untangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing design notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support these tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose semantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic slice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules, their classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is easy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming structures (DANS) properties from the source code for developing our tool. Utilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change instances based on our defined metric and then decomposes the slices (based on string processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects (developed in Java and Kotlin) reveals that the DANS properties produce highly reliable precision and recall (93-100%) for detecting and generating architectural slices. Our proposed tool will serve as the preliminary approach for the semantic design recovery and design summary generation for the project releases.</abstract><url hash="071a0f95">2021.GWF-1.19</url><doi>10.1145/3475716.3484487</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2021-Semantic</bibkey></paper><paper id="20"><title>ID-correspondence: a measure for detecting evolutionary coupling</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Existing studies and tools apply clone detectors to identify these similar co-change candidates for a target code fragment. However, clone detectors suffer from a confounding configuration choice problem and it affects their accuracy in retrieving co-change candidates.In our research, we propose and empirically evaluate a lightweight co-change suggestion technique that can automatically suggest fragment level similar co-change candidates for a target code fragment using WA-DiSC (Weighted Average Dice–Sørensen Co-efficient) through a context-sensitive mining of the entire code-base. We apply our technique, FLeCCS (Fragment Level Co-change Candidate Suggester), on six subject systems written in three different programming languages (Java, C, and C#) and compare its performance with the existing state-of-the-art techniques. According to our experiment, our technique outperforms not only the existing code clone based techniques but also the association rule mining based techniques in detecting co-change candidates with a significantly higher accuracy (precision and recall). We also find that File Proximity Ranking performs significantly better than Similarity Extent Ranking when ranking the co-change candidates suggested by our proposed technique.</abstract><url hash="22ecd464">2021.GWF-1.21</url><doi>10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00024</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2021-FLeCCS:</bibkey></paper><paper id="22"><title>Reproducibility Challenges and Their Impacts on Technical Q&amp;A Websites: The Practitioners’ Perspectives</title><author><first>Saikat</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Software developers often submit questions to technical Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow (SO) to resolve their code-level problems. Usually, they include example code segments with their questions to explain the programming issues. When users of SO attempt to answer the questions, they prefer to reproduce the issues reported in questions using the given code segments. However, such code segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet challenges (e.g., too short code segment) that might prevent questions from receiving appropriate and prompt solutions. A previous study produced a catalog of potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of issues reported at SO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers) perceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers’ perspective is inevitable to introduce interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility. We thus attempt to understand developers’ perspectives by surveying 53 users of SO. In particular, we attempt to – (1) see developers’ viewpoints on the agreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those challenges, (3) see how developers address them, and (4) determine and prioritize tool support needs. Survey results show that about 90% of participants agree to the already exposed challenges. However, they report some additional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent reproducibility. According to the participants, too short code segment and absence of required Class/Interface/Method from code segments severely prevent reproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To promote reproducibility, participants strongly recommend introducing tool support that interacts with question submitters with suggestions for improving the code segments if the given code segments fail to reproduce the issues.</abstract><url hash="bbe585de">2021.GWF-1.22</url><doi>10.1145/3511430.3511439</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2021-Reproducibility</bibkey></paper><paper id="23"><title>Automatically Generating Release Notes with Content Classification Models</title><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana Nath</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Release notes are admitted as an essential technical document in software maintenance. They summarize the main changes, e.g. bug fixes and new features, that have happened in the software since the previous release. Manually producing release notes is a time-consuming and challenging task. For that reason, sometimes developers neglect to write release notes. For example, we collect data from GitHub with over 1900 releases, and among them, 37% of the release notes are empty. To mitigate this problem, we propose an automatic release notes generation approach by applying the text summarization techniques, i.e. TextRank. To improve the keyword extraction method of traditional TextRank, we integrate the GloVe word embedding technique with TextRank. After generating release notes automatically, we apply machine learning algorithms to classify the release note contents (or sentences). We classify the contents into six categories, e.g. bug fixes and performance improvements, to represent the release notes better for users. We use the evaluation metric, e.g. ROUGE, to evaluate the automatically generated release notes. We also compare the performance of our technique with two popular extractive algorithms, e.g. Luhn’s and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Our evaluation results show that the improved TextRank method outperforms the two algorithms.</abstract><url hash="cce2b548">2021.GWF-1.23</url><doi>10.1142/s0218194021400192</doi><bibkey>Sumana Nath-etal-2021-Automatically</bibkey></paper><paper id="24"><title>Rescuing historical climate observations to support hydrological research: a case study of solar radiation data</title><author><first>Ogundepo</first><last>Odunayo</last></author><author><first>Naveela</first><last>N.

Prior to the digital age, climate records were archived on paper. For example, from the 1950s to the 1990s, solar radiation data from recording stations worldwide were published in booklets by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) Hydrometeorological Service. As a result, the data are not easily accessible by most researchers. The overarching aim of this research is to develop techniques to convert paper-based climate records into a machine-readable format to support environmental research in cold regions. This study compares the performance of a proprietary optical character recognition (OCR) service with an open-source OCR tool for digitizing hydrometeorological data. We built a digitization pipeline combining different image preprocessing techniques, semantic segmentation, and an open-source OCR engine for extracting data and metadata recorded in the scanned documents. Each page contains blocks of text with station names and tables containing the climate data. The process begins with image preprocessing to reduce noise and to improve quality before the page content is segmented to detect tables and finally run through an OCR engine for text extraction. We outline the digitization process and report on initial results, including different segmentation approaches, preprocessing image algorithms, and OCR techniques to ensure accurate extraction and organization of relevant metadata from thousands of scanned climate records. We evaluated the performance of Tesseract OCR and ABBYY FineReader on text extraction. We find that although ABBY FineReader has better accuracy on the sample data, our custom extraction pipeline using Tesseract is efficient and scalable because it is flexible and allows for more customization.</abstract><url hash="528620eb">2021.GWF-1.24</url><doi>10.1145/3469096.3474929</doi><bibkey>Odunayo-etal-2021-Rescuing</bibkey></paper><paper id="25"><title>Large Scale Image Registration Utilizing Data-Tunneling in the MapReduce Cluster</title><author><first>Amit</first><last>Kumar Mondal</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a unified framework to formulate and implement land model equations. We separate the representation of physical processes from their numerical solution, enabling the use of established robust numerical methods to solve the model equations. Second, we introduce a set of synthetic test cases (the laugh tests) to evaluate the numerical implementation of land models. The test cases include storage and transmission of water in soils, lateral sub-surface flow, coupled hydrological and thermodynamic processes in snow, and cryosuction processes in soil. We consider synthetic test cases as “laugh tests” for land models because they provide the most rudimentary test of model capabilities. The laugh tests presented in this paper are all solved with the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives model (SUMMA) implemented using the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/Algebraic equation Solvers (SUNDIALS). The numerical simulations from SUMMA/SUNDIALS are compared against (1) solutions to the synthetic test cases from other models documented in the peer-reviewed literature; (2) analytical solutions; and (3) observations made in laboratory experiments. In all cases, the numerical simulations are similar to the benchmarks, building confidence in the numerical model implementation. We posit that some land models may have difficulty in solving these benchmark problems. Dedicating more effort to solving synthetic test cases is critical in order to build confidence in the numerical implementation of land models.</abstract><url hash="cb8f7151">2021.GWF-1.27</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-20-0175.1</doi><bibkey>Clark-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="28"><title>No evidence of isotopic fractionation in olive trees (Olea europaea): a stable isotope tracing experiment</title><author><first>Anam</first><last>Amin</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Zuecco</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Marchina</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Engel</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Penna</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Borga</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT Plant transpiration is the dominant water flux in the global terrestrial water balance and a key process in the hydrological sciences. Stable isotopes have contributed greatly to this understanding but one difficult assumption for plant water source quantification using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is that no isotopic fractionation occurs during water uptake and transport within the plant. Here we present a simple glasshouse experiment with two potted olive trees to test isotopic fractionation. We irrigated the trees with labelled water and cryogenically extracted water from twigs, cores and roots. We found no significant differences in the isotopic composition of water extracted from wood cores and twigs in distinct parts of the trees as they reflected the signature of labelled water. However, significant differences were obtained between plant water and deep soil water. Our results suggest no isotopic fractionation in olive trees, under the specific experimental conditions, validating the traditional isotope-tracing approach.</abstract><url hash="5b306cc0">2021.GWF-1.28</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2021.1987440</doi><bibkey>Amin-etal-2021-No</bibkey></paper><paper id="29"><title>On the use of leaf water to determine plant water source: A proof of concept</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Benettin</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Nehemy</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Cernusak</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Kahmen</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract>Source water apportionment studies using the dual isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen have revolutionized our understanding of ecohydrology. But despite these developments—mostly over the past decade—many technical problems still exist in terms of linking xylem water to its soil water and groundwater sources. This is mainly due to sampling issues and possible fractionation of xylem water. Here we explore whether or not leaf water alone can be used to quantify the blend of rainfall event inputs from which the leaf water originates. Leaf water has historically been avoided in plant water uptake studies due to the extreme fractionation processes at the leaf surface. In our proof of concept work we embrace those processes and use the well‐known Craig and Gordon model to map leaf water back to its individual precipitation event water sources. We also employ a Bayesian uncertainty estimation approach to quantify source apportionment uncertainties. We show this using a controlled, vegetated lysimeter experiment where we were able to use leaf water to correctly identify the mean seasonal rainfall that was taken up by the plant, with an uncertainty typically within ±1‰ for δ18O. While not appropriate for all source water studies, this work shows that leaf water isotope composition may provide a new, relatively un‐intrusive method for addressing questions about the plant water source.</abstract><url hash="2c375c56">2021.GWF-1.29</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14073</doi><bibkey>Benettin-etal-2021-On</bibkey></paper><paper id="30"><title>Tracing and Closing the Water Balance in a Vegetated Lysimeter</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Benettin</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Nehemy</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Asadollahi</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Pratt</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Bensimon</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Rinaldo</last></author><abstract>Closure of the soil water balance is fundamental to ecohydrology. But closing the soil water balance with hydrometric information offers no insight into the age distribution of water transiting the soil column via deep drainage or the combination of soil evaporation and transpiration. This is a major challenge in our discipline currently; tracing the water balance is the needed next step. Here we report results from a controlled tracer experiment aimed at both closing the soil water balance and tracing its individual components. This was carried out on a 2.5 m3 lysimeter planted with a willow tree. We applied 25 mm of isotopically enriched water on top of the lysimeter and tracked it for 43 days through the soil water, the bottom drainage, and the plant xylem. We then destructively sampled the system to quantify the remaining isotope mass. More than 900 water samples were collected for stable isotope analysis to trace the labeled irrigation. We then used these data to quantify when and where the labeled irrigation became the source of plant uptake or deep percolation. Evapotranspiration dominated the water balance outflow (88%). Tracing the transpiration flux showed further that transpiration was soil water that had fallen as precipitation 1–2 months prior. The tracer breakthrough in transpiration was complex and different from the breakthrough curves observed within the soil or in the bottom drainage. Given the lack of direct experimental data on travel time to transpiration, these results provide a first balance closure where all the relevant outflows are traced.</abstract><url hash="4cf0d5b3">2021.GWF-1.30</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR029049</doi><bibkey>Benettin-etal-2021-Tracing</bibkey></paper><paper id="31"><title>Tracers reveal limited influence of plantation forests on surface runoff in a UK natural flood management catchment</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Peskett</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Heal</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>MacDonald</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Black</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3bf7e525">2021.GWF-1.31</url><doi>10.1016/J.EJRH.2021.100834</doi><bibkey>Peskett-etal-2021-Tracers</bibkey></paper><paper id="32"><title>Tropical forest water source patterns revealed by stable isotopes: A preliminary analysis of 46 neighboring species</title><author><first>M.</first><last>S.

A meta-analysis of the Canadian non-market valuation literature</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>Rute</first><last>Pinto</last></author><abstract>Abstract Three decades of non-market water quality valuation (NMWQV) studies in Canada are analyzed to generate a generic benefits transfer function. Contrary to the large valuation literature focusing on water and wilderness-based recreation in Canada, the number of studies related to water quality is limited. NMWQV studies lack a common design, including consistent adherence to a Canada-specific water quality ladder (WQL). Despite the high degree of data heterogeneity, values extracted from the literature show an increasing step function when relating them to the Resources for the Future WQL. Meta-regression models (MRMs) explain a large share of the variation in value estimates based on the type of water resources, population and methodological characteristics. Baseline water quality and the size of the water quality change are significant determinants of the estimated non-market values. With a relative mean prediction error of no more than 20 percent, the predictive power of the estimated MRMs is high. As such, they are an important step forward in the development of a policy-relevant water quality valuation model. However, there is a clear need for the development of more coherent non-market valuation guidelines in the Canadian water context.</abstract><url hash="3c9a213c">2021.GWF-1.35</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2021.1973568</doi><bibkey>Brouwer-etal-2021-How</bibkey></paper><paper id="36"><title>Using zooplankton metabarcoding to assess the efficacy of different techniques to clean-up an oil-spill in a boreal lake.</title><author><first>Phillip</first><last>J.

However, information on potential adverse effects of chronic exposure to DPhP at environmentally realistic concentrations was lacking. Here, we investigated the effects of life cycle exposure to DPhP on zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.8, 3.9, or 35.6 μg/L and employed a dual-omics approach (metabolomics and transcriptomics) to characterize potential modes of action. Exposure to DPhP at 35.6 μg/L for 120 days resulted in significant reductions in body mass and length of male zebrafish, but did not cause those same effects to females. Predominant toxicological mechanisms, including inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation, and up-regulation of phosphatidylcholine degradation, were revealed by integrated dual-omics analysis and successfully linked to adverse outcomes. Activity of succinate dehydrogenase and protein content of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 were significantly decreased in livers of male fish exposed to DPhP, which further confirmed the proposed toxicological mechanisms. This study is the first to demonstrate that chronic, low-level exposure to DPhP can retard growth via inhibiting energy output in male zebrafish.</abstract><url hash="d2944010">2021.GWF-1.37</url><doi>10.1021/acs.est.1c03948</doi><bibkey>Chen-etal-2021-Life</bibkey></paper><paper id="38"><title>Comparison of approaches to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using RT-qPCR: Results and implications from a collaborative inter-laboratory study in Canada</title><author><first>Alex</first><last>H.

Despite this, wood frogs are still present and breeding in altered landscapes, like the agricultural Prairie Pothole Region of central Canada, and are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic impacts. As tadpoles, water contamination can have negative effects on growth, development, and immune systems. To investigate the potential effects of agricultural land use on tadpole growth and immune system stress, we used boosted regression trees to model body mass, body condition, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, a measure of immune stress, against 32 variables including water quality, wetland habitat, and landscape‐level measures. Developmental stage strongly influenced all 3 endpoints, and body mass was negatively influenced by higher levels of total dissolved solids (&gt;600–700 mg/L) and at the first sign of pesticide detection (&gt;0.01 proportion pesticides detected of those screened). While correlative, these data suggest that tadpoles developing in agricultural environments may experience survival and reproductive disadvantages if they metamorphose at smaller body sizes. Given the potential impacts this can have on adult frogs and frog populations, these results provide an impetus for further field‐based investigation into the effects that pesticides, and especially total dissolved solids, may have on tadpoles.

Since lipids play a vital role in adaptation of organisms to variations in temperature, high‐resolution mass‐spectrometry‐based lipidomics can provide insights into adaptive responses of organisms to a warmer environment in the Arctic and help to illustrate potential novel roles of lipids in the process of thermal adaption. In this study, we studied an ecologically and economically important species—Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus)—with a detailed multi‐tissue analysis of the lipidome in response to chronic shifts in temperature using a validated lipidomics workflow. In addition, dynamic alterations in the hepatic lipidome during the time course of shifts in temperature were also characterized. Our results showed that early life stages of Arctic char were more susceptible to variations in temperature. One‐year‐old Arctic char responded to chronic increases in temperature with coordinated regulation of lipids, including headgroup‐specific remodeling of acyl chains in glycerophospholipids (GP) and extensive alterations in composition of lipids in membranes, such as less lyso‐GPs, and more ether‐GPs and sphingomyelin. Glycerolipids (e.g., triacylglycerol, TG) also participated in adaptive responses of the lipidome of Arctic char. Eight‐week‐old Arctic char exhibited rapid adaptive alterations of the hepatic lipidome to stepwise decreases in temperature while showing blunted responses to gradual increases in temperature, implying an inability to adapt rapidly to warmer environments. Three common phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) (PE 36:6|PE 16:1_20:5, PE 38:7|PE 16:1_22:6, and PE 40:7|PE 18:1_22:6) were finally identified as candidate lipid biomarkers for temperature shifts via machine learning approach. Overall, this work provides additional information to a better understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms of the lipidome of Arctic organisms in the face of near‐future warming.</abstract><url hash="edbf2258">2021.GWF-1.42</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15638</doi><bibkey>Wang-etal-2021-Remodeling</bibkey></paper><paper id="43"><title>Environmental DNA of preservative ethanol performed better than water samples in detecting macroinvertebrate diversity using metabarcoding</title><author><first>Yu</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Kai</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Jin</first><last>Gao</last></author><author><first>Meng</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Jie</first><last>Dong</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><author><first>Xiaowei</first><last>Jin</last></author><author><first>Beixin</first><last>Wang</last></author><abstract>High‐throughput pipelines supported by eDNA metabarcoding have been applied in various freshwater ecosystems.

However, its retrieval is challenging in small waterbodies due to the lack of high spatial-resolution water-color sensors and the substantial optical interference of other water constituents. Here, we demonstrate the potential of support vector machines and Sentinel-2 images to retrieve chla in a shallow eutrophic lake (Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada). Following validation against in-situ chla measurements over three open water seasons (2017–2019), our proposed method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms the most common semi-empirical models, i.e., locally-tuned indices (normalized difference chlorophyll index, 2band, and 3band), as well as the state-of-the-art global empirical model (Mixture Density Network). The superiority of SVR is shown in terms of overall and stratified accuracy, as well as spatial validity. We argue that for small waterbodies where numerous matched pairs of in-situ chla and reflectance are not available, SVR might retrieve chla more accurately than locally-tuned indices and global empirical models.</abstract><url hash="73dbb7fb">2021.GWF-1.45</url><doi>10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554110</doi><bibkey>Chegoonian-etal-2021-Support</bibkey></paper><paper id="46"><title>Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Haig</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Chegoonian</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Davies</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Bateson</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Leavitt</last></author><abstract>Abstract Haig HA, Chegoonian AM, Davies J-M, Bateson D, Leavitt PR. 2021. Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria. Lake Reserv Manage. 38:1–15. Continued eutrophication of inland waters by nutrient pollution can combine with unprecedented atmospheric and lake warming to create emergent environmental surprises. Here we report the first known occurrence of marked blue discoloration of ice and water in highly eutrophic prairie lakes during late winter 2021. Intense blue staining was reported first to governmental agencies by ice fishers in early March 2021, then communicated widely through social media, resulting in First Nations and public concern over potential septic field release, toxic spills, urban pollution, and agricultural mismanagement. Analysis of water from stained and reference sites using ultraviolet (UV)–visible spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that the blue color arose from high concentrations (∼14 mg/L) of the cyanobacterial pigment C-phycocyanin that was released after an unexpected bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in late October 2020 was frozen into littoral ice. Remote sensing using the Sentinel 3 A/B OLCI and Sentinel 2 A/B MSI satellite platforms suggested that blue staining encompassed 0.68 ± 0.24 km2 (4.25 ± 1.5% of lake surface area), persisted over 4 weeks, and was located within 50 m of the lakeshore in regions where fall blooms of cyanobacteria had been particularly dense. Although toxin levels were low (∼0.2 μg microcystin/L), high concentrations of C-phycocyanin raised public concern over eutrophication, pollution, and climate change, and resulted in rapid governmental and academic response. Given that climate change and nutrient pollution are increasing the magnitude and duration of cyanobacterial blooms, blue staining of lake ice may become widespread in eutrophic lakes subject to ice cover.</abstract><url hash="ead2e641">2021.GWF-1.46</url><doi>10.1080/10402381.2021.1992544</doi><bibkey>Haig-etal-2021-Marked</bibkey></paper><paper id="47"><title>Low sediment redox promotes cyanobacteria blooms across a trophic range: implications for management</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Molot</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Higgins</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Zastepa</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Verschoor</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Walters</last></author><abstract>Abstract Molot LA, Schiff SL, Venkiteswaran JJ, Baulch HM, Higgins SN, Zastepa A, Verschoor MJ, Walters D. 2021. Low sediment redox promotes cyanobacteria blooms across a trophic range: implications for management. Lake Reserv Manage. 37:120–142. Field observations and experimental manipulations with different oxidizing agents including nitrate demonstrate that high sediment redox prevents cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic freshwaters. Conversely, low sediment redox caused by depletion of dissolved oxygen and nitrate allows blooms to form. This explains why bloom risk increases with phosphorus levels: Higher productivity increases the spatial and temporal extent of low sediment redox. The intermediate link between low redox and cyanobacteria blooms appears to be internal loading of ferrous iron (Fe2+) from reduced sediments with diffusion to depths accessible to migrating cyanobacteria, providing a source for their high iron demand. Regardless of whether Fe2+ release is the intermediate link, the concept of “low sediment redox as promoter” has major potential to improve bloom management if managers consider the impact of their nutrient management choices, nutrient targets, and in-lake methods on sediment redox. Phosphorus input targets can be adjusted as climate change alters the extent of anoxia, and short-term bloom prediction models that incorporate the sediment redox concept could predict onset of blooms earlier than current models that depend on detection of photosynthetic pigments associated with blooms.</abstract><url hash="9dd5d6d7">2021.GWF-1.47</url><doi>10.1080/10402381.2020.1854400</doi><bibkey>Molot-etal-2021-Low</bibkey></paper><paper id="48"><title>Phosphorus-only fertilization rapidly initiates large nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms in two oligotrophic lakes</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Molot</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Higgins</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Paterson</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><abstract>Two small, oligotrophic lakes at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada were fertilized weekly with only phosphorus (P) in the summer and early fall of 2019.

Here, we examine a long‐term dataset from Lake 227, a site subject to a fertilization experiment (1969–present) with changing nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios. We applied a process‐oriented model, MyLake, and updated the model structure with nutrient uptake kinetics that incorporated shifting N:P and competition among phytoplankton functional groups. We also tested different temperature and P‐loading scenarios to examine the interacting effects of climate change and nutrient loading on phytoplankton blooms. The model successfully reproduced lake physics over 48 yr and the timing, overall magnitude, and shifting community structure (diazotrophs vs. non‐diazotrophs) of phytoplankton blooms. Intra‐ and interannual variability was captured more accurately for the P‐only fertilization period than for the high N:P and low N:P fertilization periods, highlighting the difficulty of modeling complex blooms even in well‐studied systems. A model scenario was also run which removed climate‐driven temperature trends, allowing us to disentangle concurrent drivers of blooms. Results showed that increases in water temperature in the spring led to earlier and larger phytoplankton blooms under climate change than under the effects of nutrient fertilization alone. These findings suggest that successful lake management efforts should incorporate the effects of climate change in addition to nutrient reductions, including intensifying and/or expanding monitoring periods and incorporating climate change into uncertainty estimates around future conditions.</abstract><url hash="7a6dfbd0">2021.GWF-1.49</url><doi>10.1002/lno.11982</doi><bibkey>R.

Yet, they are not passive victims; local-level programs are being implemented across the region to maintain livelihoods and promote adaptation. At the same time, there is a recent call within global governance literature to pay attention to how global policy is implemented and affecting people on the ground. Thinking about these two processes, we ask the question: (how) can global governance assist northern Indigenous communities in Canada in reaching their goals of adapting their food systems to climate change? To answer this question, we argue for a “community needs” approach when engaging in global governance literature and practice, which puts community priorities and decision-making first. As part of a collaborative research partnership, we highlight the experiences of Ka’a’gee Tu First Nation, located in Kakisa, NWT, Canada. We include their successes of engaging in global network building and the systemic roadblock of lack of formal land tenure. Moreover, we analyze potential opportunities for this community to engage with global governance instruments and continue connecting to global networks that further their goals related to climate change adaptation and food sovereignty.</abstract><url hash="6dad42a3">2021.GWF-1.51</url><doi>10.3390/SU13042415</doi><bibkey>Johnston-etal-2021-Grassroots</bibkey></paper><paper id="52"><title>Northern Food Systems in Transition: The Role of the Emerging Agri-Food Industry in the Northwest Territories (Canada) Food System</title><author><first>Margaret</first><last>A.

The NWT represents a unique case study in that the fledging agri-food industry has been recognized for its promise in contributing to the core goals of the transitioning NWT food system. The study is guided by two research questions: (1) How is the promise of the emerging NWT agri-food industry framed within the context of the broader food system? (2) Given this framing of the NWT agri-food industry, how can it contribute to the sustainability of the NWT food system and to the goals of food security, poverty reduction, nutrition, and economic development? Grounded in a food systems approach, we used a correlative, evolutionary SWOT analysis to profile the nascent NWT agri-food industry within the context of the existing NWT food system. Through further thematic analysis, we identify and describe two dominant narratives (agri-food industry business case narrative and agri-food industry implications narrative) and key themes within the narratives based on an adapted food systems framework. The agri-food business case narrative highlights discourse articulating the business or commercial viability for a local agri-food value chain to function, evolve, and expand. The agri-food industry implications narrative envisions the ways in which the emerging NWT agri-food industry may interact within the existing NWT food system, highlighting potential environmental, social, cultural, and political implications of an expanding commercial-based agri-food value chain. Within the two narratives, certain subcomponents of the NWT agri-food system appear to be more prevalent, including climate, soil, and ecosystems, policy/regulations/governance, socio-cultural norms, knowledge, inputs, finance, production, and consumption. We make policy and practice recommendations for co-designing an agri-food industry that serves the multiple goals of the NWT food system. As an exploratory, descriptive-structural analysis the study provides a critical empirical basis for future in-depth, fully integrated synthesis of the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and ecological dynamics shaping Northern food systems in transition.</abstract><url hash="f4a41319">2021.GWF-1.52</url><doi>10.3389/fsufs.2021.661538</doi><bibkey>A.

A reliable model for future climate should reasonably simulate the historical climate. Here, we assess the performance of CMIP6 models in reproducing statistical properties of observed annual maxima of daily precipitation. We go beyond the commonly used methods and assess CMIP6 simulations on three scales by performing: (a) univariate comparison based on L‐moments and relative difference measures; (b) bivariate comparison using Kernel densities of mean and L‐variation, and of L‐skewness and L‐kurtosis, and (c) comparison of the entire distribution function using the Generalized Extreme Value ( GEV ) distribution coupled with a novel application of the Anderson‐Darling Goodness‐of‐fit test. The results reveal that the statistical shape properties (related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes) of CMIP6 simulations match well with the observational datasets. The simulated mean and variation differ among the models with 70% of simulations having a difference within ± 10% from the observations. Biases are observed in the bivariate investigation of mean and variation. Several models perform well with the HadGEM3‐GC31‐MM model performing well in all three scales when compared to the ground‐based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre data.

Floods cause extensive damage, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments.
This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling–Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms.
To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes.
Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions.
From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling–Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.</abstract><url hash="1dc7b62c">2021.GWF-1.54</url><doi>10.5194/HESS-25-105-2021</doi><bibkey>Brunner-etal-2021-Flood</bibkey></paper><paper id="55"><title>Challenges in modeling and predicting floods and droughts: A review</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Brunner</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Slater</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Tallaksen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><abstract>Predictions of floods, droughts, and fast drought‐flood transitions are required at different time scales to develop management strategies targeted at minimizing negative societal and economic impacts. Forecasts at daily and seasonal scale are vital for early warning, estimation of event frequency for hydraulic design, and long‐term projections for developing adaptation strategies to future conditions. All three types of predictions—forecasts, frequency estimates, and projections—typically treat droughts and floods independently, even though both types of extremes can be studied using related approaches and have similar challenges. In this review, we (a) identify challenges common to drought and flood prediction and their joint assessment and (b) discuss tractable approaches to tackle these challenges. We group challenges related to flood and drought prediction into four interrelated categories: data, process understanding, modeling and prediction, and human–water interactions. Data‐related challenges include data availability and event definition. Process‐related challenges include the multivariate and spatial characteristics of extremes, non‐stationarities, and future changes in extremes. Modeling challenges arise in frequency analysis, stochastic, hydrological, earth system, and hydraulic modeling. Challenges with respect to human–water interactions lie in establishing links to impacts, representing human–water interactions, and science communication. We discuss potential ways of tackling these challenges including exploiting new data sources, studying droughts and floods in a joint framework, studying societal influences and compounding drivers, developing continuous stochastic models or non‐stationary models, and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Tackling one or several of these challenges will improve flood and drought predictions and help to minimize the negative impacts of extreme events.</abstract><url hash="6ac086ba">2021.GWF-1.55</url><doi>10.1002/wat2.1520</doi><bibkey>Brunner-etal-2021-Challenges</bibkey></paper><paper id="56"><title>Impacts of future climate on the hydrology of a transboundary river basin in northeastern North America</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Budhathoki</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="f3c9d700">2021.GWF-1.56</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127317</doi><bibkey>Budhathoki-etal-2021-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="57"><title>Open Science: Open Data, Open Models, …and Open Publications?</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Luce</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Aghakouchak</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Berghuijs</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>David</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Duan</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Ge</last></author><author><first>Ilja</first><last>van Meerveld</last></author><author><first>Chunmiao</first><last>Zheng</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Parlange</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Tyler</last></author><abstract>This commentary explores the challenges and opportunities associated with a possible transition of Water Resources Research to a publication model where all articles are freely available upon publication (“Gold” open access).

We focus on the Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling‐Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large‐sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.</abstract><url hash="1471fa07">2021.GWF-1.58</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR029001</doi><bibkey>Clark-etal-2021-The1</bibkey></paper><paper id="59"><title>Exploring the Potential of Zoning Regulation for Reducing Ice-Jam Flood Risk Using a Stochastic Modelling Framework</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>Ice-jam floods pose a serious threat to many riverside communities in cold regions. Ice-jam-related flooding can cause loss of human life, millions of dollars in property damage, and adverse impacts on ecology. An effective flood management strategy is necessary to reduce the overall risk in flood-prone areas. Most of these strategies require a detailed risk-based management study to assess their effectiveness in reducing flood risk. Zoning regulation is a sustainable measure to reduce overall flood risk for a flood-prone area. Zoning regulation is a specified area in a floodplain where certain restrictions apply to different land uses (e.g., development or business). A stochastic framework was introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of a potential zoning regulation. A stochastic framework encompasses the impacts of all the possible expected floods instead of a more traditional approach where a single design flood is incorporated. The downtown area of Fort McMurray along the Athabasca River was selected to explore the impact of zoning regulation on reducing expected annual damages (EAD) from ice-jam flooding. The results show that a hypothetical zoning regulation for a certain area in the town of Fort McMurray (TFM) can be effective in substantially reducing the level of EAD. A global sensitivity analysis was also applied to understand the impacts of model inputs on ice-jam flood risk using a regional sensitivity method. The results show that model boundary conditions such as river discharge, the inflowing volume of ice and ice-jam toe locations are highly sensitive to ice-jam flood risk.</abstract><url hash="6376ca91">2021.GWF-1.59</url><doi>10.3390/w13162202</doi><bibkey>Das-etal-2021-Exploring</bibkey></paper><paper id="60"><title>Modelling climatic impacts on ice-jam floods: a review of current models, modelling capabilities, challenges, and future prospects</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>River ice is an important hydraulic and hydrological component of many rivers in the high northern latitudes of the world.

We explain and quantify output differences with individual model structure components at both the numerical (e.g., explicit/implicit scheme) and mathematical level (e.g., lineair/power outflow). It was found that none of the numerical and mathematical formulations of the mimicking models were (originally) the same as the benchmark, HBV‐light. This led to small but distinct output differences in simulated streamflow for different numerical implementations (KGE difference up to 0.15), and major output differences due to mathematical differences (KGE median loss of 0.27). These differences decreased after calibrating the individual models to the simulated streamflow of the benchmark model. We argue that the lack of systematic model naming has led to a diverging concept of the HBV‐model, diminishing the concept of model mimicry. Development of a systematic model naming framework, open accessible model code and more elaborate model descriptions are suggested to enhance model mimicry and model development.</abstract><url hash="df8940da">2021.GWF-1.62</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR029143</doi><bibkey>Jansen-etal-2021-Mimicry</bibkey></paper><paper id="63"><title>Numerical daemons of hydrological models are summoned by

Hydrological models are usually systems of nonlinear differential equations for which no analytical solutions exist and thus rely on approximate numerical solutions. While some studies have investigated the relationship between numerical method choice and model error, the extent to which extreme precipitation like that observed during hurricanes Harvey and Katrina impacts numerical error of hydrological models is still unknown. This knowledge is relevant in light of climate change, where many regions will likely experience more intense precipitation events. In this experiment, a large number of hydrographs is generated with the modular modeling framework FUSE, using eight numerical techniques across a variety of forcing datasets. Multiple model structures, parameter sets, and initial conditions are incorporated for generality. The computational expense and numerical error associated with each hydrograph were recorded. It was found that numerical error (root mean square error) usually increases with precipitation intensity and decreases with event duration. Some numerical methods constrain errors much more effectively than others, sometimes by many orders of magnitude. Of the tested numerical methods, a second-order adaptive explicit method is found to be the most efficient because it has both low numerical error and low computational cost. A basic literature review indicates that many popular modeling codes use numerical techniques that were suggested by this experiment to be sub-optimal. We conclude that relatively large numerical errors might be common in current models, and because these will likely become larger as the climate changes, we advocate for the use of low cost, low error numerical methods.

Here idealized perturbations to land surface properties are imposed in a global model to understand how such forcings drive shifts in zonal mean atmospheric energy transport and zonal mean tropical precipitation. For a uniform decrease in global land albedo, the albedo forcing and a positive water vapor feedback contribute roughly equally to increased energy absorption at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), while radiative changes due to the temperature and cloud cover response provide a negative feedback and energy loss at TOA. Decreasing land albedo causes a northwards shift in the zonal mean intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The combined effects on ITCZ location of all atmospheric feedbacks roughly cancel for the albedo forcing; the total ITCZ shift is comparable to that predicted for the albedo forcing alone. For an imposed increase in evaporative resistance that reduces land evaporation, low cloud cover decreases in the northern mid-latitudes and more energy is absorbed at TOA there; longwave loss due to warming provides a negative feedback on the TOA energy balance and ITCZ shift. Imposed changes in land albedo and evaporative resistance modulate fundamentally different aspects of the surface energy budget. However, the pattern of TOA radiation changes due to the water vapor and air temperature responses are highly correlated for these two forcings because both forcings lead to near-surface warming.</abstract><url hash="36eae5ef">2021.GWF-1.64</url><doi>10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0883.1</doi><bibkey>Laguë-etal-2021-Radiative</bibkey></paper><paper id="65"><title>Leveraging ensemble meteorological forcing data to improve parameter estimation of hydrologic models</title><author><first>Hongli</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Tolson</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Wood</last></author><abstract>As continental to global scale high‐resolution meteorological datasets continue to be developed, there are sufficient meteorological datasets available now for modellers to construct a historical forcing ensemble. The forcing ensemble can be a collection of multiple deterministic meteorological datasets or come from an ensemble meteorological dataset. In hydrological model calibration, the forcing ensemble can be used to represent forcing data uncertainty. This study examines the potential of using the forcing ensemble to identify more robust parameters through model calibration. Specifically, we compare an ensemble forcing‐based calibration with two deterministic forcing‐based calibrations and investigate their flow simulation and parameter estimation properties and the ability to resist poor‐quality forcings. The comparison experiment is conducted with a six‐parameter hydrological model for 30 synthetic studies and 20 real data studies to provide a better assessment of the average performance of the deterministic and ensemble forcing‐based calibrations. Results show that the ensemble forcing‐based calibration generates parameter estimates that are less biased and have higher frequency of covering the true parameter values than the deterministic forcing‐based calibration does. Using a forcing ensemble in model calibration reduces the risk of inaccurate flow simulation caused by poor‐quality meteorological inputs, and improves the reliability and overall simulation skill of ensemble simulation results. The poor‐quality meteorological inputs can be effectively filtered out via our ensemble forcing‐based calibration methodology and thus discarded in any post‐calibration model applications. The proposed ensemble forcing‐based calibration method can be considered as a more generalized framework to include parameter and forcing uncertainties in model calibration.</abstract><url hash="41edd579">2021.GWF-1.65</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14410</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2021-Leveraging</bibkey></paper><paper id="66"><title>Dryline characteristics in North America’s historical and future climates</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Scaff</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Prein</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Krogh</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Taylor</last></author><author><first>Changhai</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Ikeda</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d8e484c3">2021.GWF-1.66</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-021-05800-1</doi><bibkey>Scaff-etal-2021-Dryline</bibkey></paper><paper id="67"><title>A Vector‐Based River Routing Model for Earth System Models: Parallelization and Global Applications</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Gharari</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Kluzek</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Pan</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lin</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Beck</last></author><author><first>Dai</first><last>Yamazaki</last></author><abstract>A vector‐river network explicitly uses realistic geometries of river reaches and catchments for spatial discretization in a river model. This enables improving the accuracy of the physical properties of the modeled river system, compared to a gridded river network that has been used in Earth System Models. With a finer‐scale river network, resolving smaller‐scale river reaches, there is a need for efficient methods to route streamflow and its constituents throughout the river network. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) develop a new method to decompose river networks into hydrologically independent tributary domains, where routing computations can be performed in parallel; and (2) perform global river routing simulations with two global river networks, with different scales, to examine the computational efficiency and the differences in discharge simulations at various temporal scales. The new parallelization method uses a hierarchical decomposition strategy, where each decomposed tributary is further decomposed into many sub‐tributary domains, enabling hybrid parallel computing. This parallelization scheme has excellent computational scaling for the global domain where it is straightforward to distribute computations across many independent river basins. However, parallel computing for a single large basin remains challenging. The global routing experiments show that the scale of the vector‐river network has less impact on the discharge simulations than the runoff input that is generated by the combination of land surface model and meteorological forcing. The scale of vector‐river networks needs to consider the scale of local hydrologic features such as lakes that are to be resolved in the network.</abstract><url hash="afe3b455">2021.GWF-1.67</url><doi>10.1029/2020MS002434</doi><bibkey>Mizukami-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="68"><title>Identifying sensitivities in flood frequency analyses using a stochastic hydrologic modeling system</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Stone</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Saharia</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>D.

This study employs a stochastic hydrologic modeling framework to evaluate the sensitivity of flood frequency analyses to different components of the hydrologic modeling chain. The major components of the stochastic hydrologic modeling chain, including model structure, model parameter estimation, initial conditions, and precipitation inputs were examined across return periods from 2 to 100 000 years at two watersheds
representing different hydroclimates across the western USA. A total of 10 hydrologic model structures were configured, calibrated, and run within the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) modular modeling
framework for each of the two watersheds. Model parameters and initial
conditions were derived from long-term calibrated simulations using a
100 member historical meteorology ensemble. A stochastic event-based
hydrologic modeling workflow was developed using the calibrated models in
which millions of flood event simulations were performed for each basin. The analysis of variance method was then used to quantify the relative
contributions of model structure, model parameters, initial conditions, and
precipitation inputs to flood magnitudes for different return periods.
Results demonstrate that different components of the modeling chain have
different sensitivities for different return periods. Precipitation inputs
contribute most to the variance of rare floods, while initial conditions are
most influential for more frequent events. However, the hydrological model
structure and structure–parameter interactions together play an equally
important role in specific cases, depending on the basin characteristics and type of flood metric of interest. This study highlights the importance of critically assessing model underpinnings, understanding flood generation
processes, and selecting appropriate hydrological models that are consistent with our understanding of flood generation processes.

Climate models are important in quantifying drought changes. Here, we assess the ability of 285 CMIP6 historical simulations, from 17 models, to reproduce drought duration and severity in three observational data sets using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). We used summary statistics beyond the mean and standard deviation, and devised a novel probabilistic framework, based on the Hellinger distance, to quantify the difference between observed and simulated drought characteristics. Results show that many simulations have less than ±10% error in reproducing the observed drought summary statistics. The hypothesis that simulations and observations are described by the same distribution cannot be rejected for more than 80% of the grids based on our H distance framework. No single model stood out as demonstrating consistently better performance over large regions of the globe. The variance in drought statistics among the simulations is higher in the tropics compared to other latitudinal zones. Though the models capture the characteristics of dry spells well, there is considerable bias in low precipitation values. Good model performance in terms of SPI does not imply good performance in simulating low precipitation. Our study emphasizes the need to probabilistically evaluate climate model simulations in order to both pinpoint model weaknesses and identify a subset of best‐performing models that are useful for impact assessments.</abstract><url hash="485b9952">2021.GWF-1.69</url><doi>10.1029/2021EF002150</doi><bibkey>Papalexiou-etal-2021-Probabilistic</bibkey></paper><paper id="70"><title>Changing River Network Synchrony Modulates Projected Increases in High Flows</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Rupp</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Chegwidden</last></author><author><first>Bart</first><last>Nijssen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><abstract>Projections of change in high‐flow extremes with global warming vary widely among, and within, large midlatitude river basins. The spatial variability of these changes is attributable to multiple causes. One possible and little‐studied cause of changes in high‐flow extremes is a change in the synchrony of mainstem and tributary streamflow during high‐flow extremes at the mainstem‐tributary confluence. We examined reconstructed and simulated naturalized daily streamflow at confluences on the Columbia River in western North America, quantifying changes in synchrony in future streamflow projections and estimating the impact of these changes on high‐flow extremes. In the Columbia River basin, projected flow regimes across colder tributaries initially diverge with warming as they respond to climate change at different rates, leading to a general decrease in synchrony, and lower high‐flow extremes, relative to a scenario with no changes in synchrony. Where future warming is sufficiently large to cause most subbasins upstream from a confluence to transition toward a rain‐dominated, warm regime, the decreasing trend in synchrony reverses itself. At one confluence with a major tributary (the Willamette River), where the mainstem and tributary flow regimes are initially very different, warming increases synchrony and, therefore, high‐flow magnitudes. These results may be generalizable to the class of large rivers with large contributions to flood risk from the snow (i.e., cold) regime, but that also receive considerable discharge from tributaries that drain warmer basins.</abstract><url hash="289c10b7">2021.GWF-1.70</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR028713</doi><bibkey>Rupp-etal-2021-Changing</bibkey></paper><paper id="71"><title>Effects of quality controlled measured and re-analysed meteorological data on the performance of water temperature simulations</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Sadeghian</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hudson</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT One of the most prominent sources of error and uncertainty in water quality modelling results is the input data.

GSA has been extensively used for model simplification, identifiability analysis, and diagnostic tests. Nevertheless, computationally efficient methodologies are needed for GSA, not only to reduce the computational overhead, but also to improve the quality and robustness of the results. This is especially the case for process‐based hydrologic models, as their simulation time typically exceeds the computational resources available for a comprehensive GSA. To overcome this computational barrier, we propose a data‐driven method called VISCOUS, variance‐based sensitivity analysis using copulas. VISCOUS uses Gaussian mixture copulas to approximate the joint probability density function of a given set of input‐output pairs for estimating the variance‐based sensitivity indices. Our method identifies dominant hydrologic factors by recycling existing input‐output data, and thus can deal with arbitrary sample sets drawn from the input‐output space. We used two hydrologic models of increasing complexity (HBV and VIC) to assess the performance of VISCOUS. Our results confirm that VISCOUS and the conventional variance‐based method can detect similar important and unimportant factors. Furthermore, the VISCOUS method can substantially reduce the computational cost required for sensitivity analysis. Our proposed method is particularly useful for process‐based models with many uncertain parameters, large domain size, and high spatial and temporal resolution.</abstract><url hash="c692719b">2021.GWF-1.72</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR028435</doi><bibkey>Sheikholeslami-etal-2021-VISCOUS:</bibkey></paper><paper id="73"><title>How Do Climate and Catchment Attributes Influence Flood Generating Processes?

Knowledge about flood generating processes improves hydrological models, flood frequency analysis, estimation of climate change impact on floods, etc. Yet, not much is known about how climate and catchment attributes influence the spatial distribution of flood generating processes. This study aims to offer a comprehensive and structured approach to close this knowledge gap. We employ a large sample approach (671 catchments across the contiguous United States) and evaluate how catchment attributes and climate attributes influence the distribution of flood processes. We use two complementary approaches: A statistics‐based approach which compares attribute frequency distributions of different flood processes; and a random forest model in combination with an interpretable machine learning approach (accumulated local effects [ALE]). The ALE method has not been used often in hydrology, and it overcomes a significant obstacle in many statistical methods, the confounding effect of correlated catchment attributes. As expected, we find climate attributes (fraction of snow, aridity, precipitation seasonality, and mean precipitation) to be most influential on flood process distribution. However, the influence of catchment attributes varies both with flood generating process and climate type. We also find flood processes can be predicted for ungauged catchments with relatively high accuracy (R2 between 0.45 and 0.9). The implication of these findings is flood processes should be considered for future climate change impact studies, as the effect of changes in climate on flood characteristics varies between flood processes.</abstract><url hash="b195410d">2021.GWF-1.73</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR028300</doi><bibkey>Stein-etal-2021-How</bibkey></paper><paper id="74"><title>SC-Earth: A Station-based Serially Complete Earth Dataset from 1950 to 2019</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract>Meteorological data from ground stations suffer from temporal discontinuities caused by missing values and short measurement periods. Gap filling and reconstruction techniques have proven to be effective in producing serially complete station datasets (SCDs) that are used for a myriad of meteorological applications (e.g., developing gridded meteorological datasets and validating models). To our knowledge, all SCDs are developed at regional scales. In this study, we developed the serially complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which provides daily precipitation, mean temperature, temperature range, dew-point temperature, and wind speed data from 1950 to 2019. SC-Earth utilizes raw station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). A unified station repository is generated based on GHCN-D and GSOD after station merging and strict quality control. ERA5 is optimally matched with station data considering the time shift issue and then used to assist the global gap filling. SC-Earth is generated by merging estimates from 15 strategies based on quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, machine learning, and multi-strategy merging. The final estimates are bias corrected using a combination of quantile mapping and quantile delta mapping. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that SC-Earth has high accuracy around the globe, with degraded quality in the tropics and oceanic islands due to sparse station networks, strong spatial precipitation gradients, and degraded ERA5 estimates. Meanwhile, SC-Earth inherits potential limitations such as inhomogeneity and precipitation undercatch from raw station data, which may affect its application in some cases. Overall, the high-quality and high-density SC-Earth dataset will benefit research in fields of hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and climate.</abstract><url hash="2ff1d4ae">2021.GWF-1.74</url><doi>10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0067.1</doi><bibkey>Tang-etal-2021-SC-Earth:</bibkey></paper><paper id="75"><title>The use of serially complete station data to improve the temporal continuity of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract>Stations are an important source of meteorological data, but often suffer from missing values and short observation periods. Gap filling is widely used to generate serially complete datasets (SCDs), which are subsequently used to produce gridded meteorological estimates. However, the value of SCDs in spatial interpolation is scarcely studied. Based on our recent efforts to develop a SCD over North America (SCDNA), we explore the extent to which gap filling improves gridded precipitation and temperature estimates. We address two specific questions: (1) Can SCDNA improve the statistical accuracy of gridded estimates in North America? (2) Can SCDNA improve estimates of trends on gridded data? In addressing these questions, we also evaluate the extent to which results depend on the spatial density of the station network and the spatial interpolation methods used. Results show that the improvement in statistical interpolation due to gap filling is more obvious for precipitation, followed by minimum temperature and maximum temperature. The improvement is larger when the station network is sparse and when simpler interpolation methods are used. SCDs can also notably reduce the uncertainties in spatial interpolation. Our evaluation across North America from 1979 to 2018 demonstrates that SCDs improve the accuracy of interpolated estimates for most stations and days. SCDNA-based interpolation also obtains better trend estimation than observation-based interpolation. This occurs because stations used for interpolation could change during a specific period, causing changepoints in interpolated temperature estimates and affect the long-term trends of observation-based interpolation, which can be avoided using SCDNA. Overall, SCDs improve the performance of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates.</abstract><url hash="58f6e438">2021.GWF-1.75</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-20-0313.1</doi><bibkey>Tang-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="76"><title>EMDNA: an Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Wood</last></author><author><first>Dominique</first><last>Brunet</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Probabilistic methods are useful to estimate the
uncertainty in spatial meteorological fields (e.g., the uncertainty in
spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature across large domains). In
ensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members are
used to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, of
a spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the available
information. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact of
uncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications.
This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America
(EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount,
mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1∘
spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from a
fusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The station
data used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America
(SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements using
multiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded,
corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimal
interpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates.
EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated random
fields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) the
merged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates,
particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimates
are more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regression
estimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident in
sparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performance
according to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. We
discuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that further
research is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall,
EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorological
applications in North America. The entire dataset and a teaser dataset (a
small subset of EMDNA for easy download and preview) are available at

Surface meteorological analyses are an essential input (termed ‘forcing’) for hydrologic modeling. This study investigated the sensitivity of different hydrologic model configurations to temporal variations of seven forcing variables (precipitation rate, air temperature, longwave radiation, specific humidity, shortwave radiation, wind speed, and air pressure). Specifically, the effects of temporally aggregating hourly forcings to hourly daily-average forcings were examined. The analysis was based on 14 hydrological outputs from the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) model for the 671 Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) basins across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Results demonstrated that the hydrologic model sensitivity to temporally aggregating the forcing inputs varies across model output variables and model locations. We used Latin Hypercube sampling to sample model parameters from eight combinations of three influential model physics choices (three model decisions with two options for each decision, i.e., eight model configurations). Results showed that the choice of model physics can change the relative influence of forcing on model outputs and the forcing importance may not be dependent on the parameter space. This allows for model output sensitivity to forcing aggregation to be tested prior to parameter calibration. More generally, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the dependence of modeled outcomes on input forcing behavior, providing insight into the regional variability of forcing variable dominance on modeled outputs across CONUS.</abstract><url hash="b6f88514">2021.GWF-1.77</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-21-0111.1</doi><bibkey>V.

Yet very little is known about the impacts of reservoir expansion on the climate. Here, we implement reservoir construction in the Community Land Model by enabling dynamical lake area changes, while conserving mass and energy. Transient global lake and reservoir extent are prescribed from the HydroLAKES and Global Reservoir and Dam databases. Land‐only simulations covering the 20th century with reservoir expansion enabled, highlight increases in terrestrial water storage and decreases in albedo matching the increase in open water area. The comparison of coupled simulations including and excluding reservoirs shows only limited influence of reservoirs on global temperatures and the surface energy balance, but demonstrates substantial responses locally, in particular where reservoirs make up a large fraction of the grid cell. In those locations, reservoirs dampen the diurnal temperature range by up to −1.5 K (for reservoirs covering &gt;15% of the grid cell), reduce temperature extremes, and moderate the seasonal temperature cycle. This study provides a first step towards a coupled representation of reservoirs in Earth System Models.</abstract><url hash="26479885">2021.GWF-1.78</url><doi>10.1029/2020JD034485</doi><bibkey>Vanderkelen-etal-2021-Simulating</bibkey></paper><paper id="79"><title>Canadian historical Snow Water Equivalent dataset (CanSWE, 1928–2020)</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Vionnet</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Mortimer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Brady</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Arnal</last></author><author><first>Ross</first><last>D.

In situ measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) – the depth of water that would be produced if all the snow melted – are used in many applications including water management, flood forecasting, climate monitoring, and evaluation of hydrological and land surface models. The Canadian historical SWE dataset (CanSWE) combines manual and automated pan-Canadian SWE observations collected by national, provincial and territorial agencies as well as hydropower companies. Snow depth and derived bulk snow density are also included when available. This new dataset supersedes the previous Canadian Historical Snow Survey (CHSSD) dataset published by Brown et al. (2019), and this paper describes the efforts made to correct metadata, remove duplicate observations, and quality control records. The CanSWE dataset was compiled from 15 different sources and includes SWE information for all provinces and territories that measure SWE. Data were updated to July 2020 and new historical data from the Government of Northwest Territories, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan Water Security Agency, and Hydro Quebec were included. CanSWE includes over one million SWE measurements from 2607 different locations across Canada over the period 1928–2020. It is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4734372 (Vionnet et al., 2021).

face rapid change. Their hydrology is dominated by snow, ice and frozen
soils, and climate warming is having profound effects. Hydrological
models have a key role in predicting changing water resources, but are
challenged in cold regions. Ground-based data to quantify meteorological
forcing and constrain model parameterization are limited, while
hydrological processes are complex, often controlled by phase change
energetics. River flows are impacted by poorly quantified human
activities. This paper reports scientific developments over the past
decade of MESH, the Canadian community hydrological land surface scheme.
New cold region process representation includes improved blowing snow
transport and sublimation, lateral land-surface flow, prairie pothole
storage dynamics, frozen ground infiltration and thermodynamics, and
improved glacier modelling. New algorithms to represent water management
include multi-stage reservoir operation. Parameterization has been
supported by field observations and remotely sensed data; new methods
for parameter identification have been used to evaluate model
uncertainty and support regionalization. Additionally, MESH has been
linked to broader decision-support frameworks, including river ice
simulation and hydrological forecasting. The paper also reports various
applications to the Saskatchewan and Mackenzie River basins in western
Canada (0.4 and 1.8 million km). These basins arise
in glaciated mountain headwaters, are partly underlain by permafrost,
and include remote and incompletely understood forested, wetland,
agricultural and tundra ecoregions. This imposes extraordinary
challenges to prediction, including the need to overcoming biases in
forcing data sets, which can have disproportionate effects on the
simulated hydrology.</abstract><url hash="af040c78">2021.GWF-1.80</url><doi>10.22541/au.162738548.88997933/v1</doi><bibkey>Wheater-etal-2021-Advances</bibkey></paper><paper id="81"><title>The Perils of Regridding: Examples using a Global Precipitation Dataset</title><author><first>C.</first><last>R.

Regridding precipitation datasets is common for model coupling (e.g., coupling atmospheric and hydrological models) or comparing different models and datasets. However, regridding can considerably alter precipitation statistics. In this global analysis, the effects of regridding a precipitation dataset are emphasized using three regridding methods (first order conservative, bilinear, and distance weighted averaging). The differences between the original and regridded dataset are substantial and greatest at high quantiles. Differences of 46 mm and 0.13 mm are noted in high (0.95) and low (0.05) quantiles respectively. The impacts of regridding vary spatially for land and oceanic regions; there are substantial differences at high quantiles in tropical land regions, and at low quantiles in polar regions. These impacts are approximately the same for different regridding methods. The differences increase with the size of the grid at higher quantiles and vice versa for low quantiles. As the grid resolution increases, the difference between original and regridded data declines, yet the shift size dominates for high quantiles for which the differences are higher. Whilst regridding is often necessary to use gridded precipitation datasets, it should be used with great caution for fine resolutions (e.g., daily and sub-daily), as it can severely alter the statistical properties of precipitation, specifically at high and low quantiles.</abstract><url hash="d8033cee">2021.GWF-1.81</url><doi>10.1175/jamc-d-20-0259.1</doi><bibkey>R.

Whilst there is general support for making data more broadly accessible, and a number of water science journals and funding agencies have adopted policies that require researchers to share data in accordance with the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) principles, there are still questions about effective management of data to protect their usefulness over time. Incorporating data management practices and standards at the outset of a water science research project will enable researchers to efficiently locate, analyse and use data throughout the project lifecycle, and will ensure the data maintain their value after the project has ended. Here, some common misconceptions about data management are highlighted, along with insights and practical advice to assist established and early career water science researchers as they integrate data management best practices and tools into their research. Freely available tools and training opportunities made available in Canada through Global Water Futures, The Gordon Foundation DataStream, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada Portage Network, Compute Canada, and university libraries, among others are compiled. These include webinars, training videos, and individual support for the water science community that together enable researchers to protect their data assets and meet the expectations of journals and funders. The perspectives shared here have been developed as part of the Global Water Futures programme's efforts to improve data management and promote the use of common data practices and standards in the context of water science in Canada. Ten best practices are proposed that may be broadly applicable to other disciplines in the natural sciences and can be adopted and adapted globally.</abstract><url hash="a869c861">2021.GWF-1.84</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14385</doi><bibkey>Persaud-etal-2021-Ten</bibkey></paper><paper id="85"><title>A stochastic modelling approach to forecast real-time ice jam flood severity along the transborder (New Brunswick/Maine) Saint John River of North America</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Budhathoki</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="df6ef8f7">2021.GWF-1.85</url><doi>10.1007/s00477-022-02234-x</doi><bibkey>Das-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="86"><title>Joint effects of climate, tree size, and year on annual tree growth derived from tree‐ring records of ten globally distributed forests</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Anderson‐Teixeira</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Herrmann</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Rollinson</last></author><author><first>Bianca</first><last>Gonzalez</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Gonzalez-Akre</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Pederson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>R.

However, conventional tree‐ring analysis methods were not designed to simultaneously test effects of climate, tree size, and other drivers on individual growth. This has limited the potential to test ecologically relevant hypotheses on tree growth sensitivity to environmental drivers and their interactions with tree size. Here, we develop and apply a new method to simultaneously model nonlinear effects of primary climate drivers, reconstructed tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and calendar year in generalized least squares models that account for the temporal autocorrelation inherent to each individual tree's growth. We analyze data from 3811 trees representing 40 species at 10 globally distributed sites, showing that precipitation, temperature, DBH, and calendar year have additively, and often interactively, influenced annual growth over the past 120 years. Growth responses were predominantly positive to precipitation (usually over ≥3‐month seasonal windows) and negative to temperature (usually maximum temperature, over ≤3‐month seasonal windows), with concave‐down responses in 63% of relationships. Climate sensitivity commonly varied with DBH (45% of cases tested), with larger trees usually more sensitive. Trends in ring width at small DBH were linked to the light environment under which trees established, but basal area or biomass increments consistently reached maxima at intermediate DBH. Accounting for climate and DBH, growth rate declined over time for 92% of species in secondary or disturbed stands, whereas growth trends were mixed in older forests. These trends were largely attributable to stand dynamics as cohorts and stands age, which remain challenging to disentangle from global change drivers. By providing a parsimonious approach for characterizing multiple interacting drivers of tree growth, our method reveals a more complete picture of the factors influencing growth than has previously been possible.</abstract><url hash="4667a94d">2021.GWF-1.86</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15934</doi><bibkey>Anderson‐Teixeira-etal-2021-Joint</bibkey></paper><paper id="87"><title>Increasing fire and the decline of fire adapted black spruce in the boreal forest</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>J.

However, climate warming and increases in wildfire activity may be undermining its ability to maintain dominance, shifting forests toward alternative forested and nonforested states. Using data from across North America, we evaluate whether loss of black spruce resilience is already widespread. Resilience was the most common outcome, but drier climatic conditions and more severe fires consistently undermine resilience, often resulting in complete regeneration failure. Although black spruce forests are currently moderately resilient, ongoing warming and drying may alter this trajectory, with large potential consequences for the functioning of this globally important biome. Intensifying wildfire activity and climate change can drive rapid forest compositional shifts. In boreal North America, black spruce shapes forest flammability and depends on fire for regeneration. This relationship has helped black spruce maintain its dominance through much of the Holocene. However, with climate change and more frequent and severe fires, shifts away from black spruce dominance to broadleaf or pine species are emerging, with implications for ecosystem functions including carbon sequestration, water and energy fluxes, and wildlife habitat. Here, we predict that such reductions in black spruce after fire may already be widespread given current trends in climate and fire. To test this, we synthesize data from 1,538 field sites across boreal North America to evaluate compositional changes in tree species following 58 recent fires (1989 to 2014). While black spruce was resilient following most fires (62%), loss of resilience was common, and spruce regeneration failed completely in 18% of 1,140 black spruce sites. In contrast, postfire regeneration never failed in forests dominated by jack pine, which also possesses an aerial seed bank, or broad-leaved trees. More complete combustion of the soil organic layer, which often occurs in better-drained landscape positions and in dryer duff, promoted compositional changes throughout boreal North America. Forests in western North America, however, were more vulnerable to change due to greater long-term climate moisture deficits. While we find considerable remaining resilience in black spruce forests, predicted increases in climate moisture deficits and fire activity will erode this resilience, pushing the system toward a tipping point that has not been crossed in several thousand years.</abstract><url hash="316099db">2021.GWF-1.87</url><doi>10.1073/pnas.2024872118</doi><bibkey>Baltzer-etal-2021-Increasing</bibkey></paper><paper id="88"><title>Seasonal thaw and landscape position determine foliar functional traits and whole-plant water use in tall shrubs on the low arctic tundra.</title><author><first>Katherine</first><last>L.

Understanding associations between shrub ecophysiological function, distribution, and environment is necessary for predicting consequences of expansion. We evaluated the role of topographic gradients on upland shrub productivity to understand potential constraints on shrub expansion. At a low arctic tundra site near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, we measured sap flow, stem water potential, and productivity-related functional traits in green alder and environmental predictors (water and nutrient availability and seasonal thaw depth) across a toposequence in alder patches. Seasonal thaw reduced stem sap flow while topographic position predicted stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits. Upslope shrubs were more water-limited than those downslope. Shrubs in drainage channels had traits associated with greater productivity than those on the tops of slopes. The effect of thaw depth on sap flow has implications for seasonal water-use patterns and warming impacts on tundra ecohydrology. Topographic variation in functional traits corresponds with observed spatial patterns of tundra shrub expansion along floodplains and concave hillslopes rather than in upland areas. Green alder is expanding rapidly across the low arctic tundra in northwestern North America; anticipating implications of its expansion is essential for predicting tundra function.</abstract><url hash="a1df844a">2021.GWF-1.88</url><doi>10.1111/nph.17375</doi><bibkey>L.

Snowmelt constitutes a primary source of moisture supply for the short growing season and strongly influences stream hydrographs. Permafrost thaw has changed the landscape by increasing the proportional coverage of permafrost‐free wetlands at the expense of permafrost‐cored peat plateau forests. The biophysical characteristics of each feature affect snow water equivalent (SWE) accumulation and melt rates. In headwater streams in the southern Dehcho region of the NWT, snowmelt runoff has significantly increased over the past 50 years, despite no significant change in annual SWE. At the Fort Simpson A climate station, we found that SWE measurements made by Environment and Climate Change Canada using a Nipher precipitation gauge were more accurate than the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Dataset which was derived from snow depth measurements. Here, we: (a) provide 13 years of snow survey data to demonstrate differences in end‐of‐season SWE between wetlands and plateau forests; (b) provide ablation stake and radiation measurements to document differences in snow melt patterns among wetlands, plateau forests, and upland forests; and (c) evaluate the potential impact of permafrost‐thaw induced wetland expansion on SWE accumulation, melt, and runoff. We found that plateaus retain significantly (p &lt; 0.01) more SWE than wetlands. However, the differences are too small (123 mm and 111 mm, respectively) to cause any substantial change in basin SWE. During the snowmelt period in 2015, wetlands were the first feature to become snow‐free in mid‐April, followed by plateau forests (7 days after wetlands) and upland forests (18 days after wetlands). A transition to a higher percentage cover of wetlands may lead to more rapid snowmelt and provide a more hydrologically‐connected landscape, a plausible mechanism driving the observed increase in spring freshet runoff.</abstract><url hash="b61f3d39">2021.GWF-1.90</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14363</doi><bibkey>Connon-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="91"><title>Arctic freshwater biodiversity: Establishing baselines, trends, and drivers of ecological change</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Culp</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Goedkoop</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Christensen</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Christoffersen</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Fefilova</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Liljaniemi</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Novichkova</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Ólafsson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Sandøy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Zimmerman</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Lento</last></author><abstract>1.

These indices show that productivity is generally declining in the boreal forest, but it is unclear which components of boreal vegetation are driving these trends. We aimed to compare trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to forest growth and demographic data taken from a 10 ha mapped plot located in a spruce‐dominated boreal peatland. We used microcores to quantify recent growth trends and tree census data to characterize mortality and recruitment rates of the three dominant tree species. We then compared spatial patterns in growth and demography to patterns in Landsat‐derived maximum NDVI trends (1984–2019) in 78 pixels that fell within the plot. We found that NDVI trends were predominantly positive (i.e., “greening”) in spite of the ongoing loss of black spruce (the dominant species; 80% of stems) from the plot. The magnitude of these trends correlated positively with black spruce growth trends, but was also governed to a large extent by tree mortality and recruitment. Greening trends were weaker (lower slope) in areas with high larch mortality, and high turnover of spruce and birch, but stronger (higher slope) in areas with high larch recruitment. Larch dominance is currently low (~11% of stems), but it is increasing in abundance as permafrost thaw progresses and will likely have a substantial influence on future NDVI trends. Our results emphasize that NDVI trends in boreal peatlands can be positive even when the forest as a whole is in decline, and that the magnitude of trends can be strongly influenced by the demographics of uncommon species.</abstract><url hash="58115c15">2021.GWF-1.92</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15608</doi><bibkey>Dearborn-etal-2021-Unexpected</bibkey></paper><paper id="93"><title>FLUXNET-CH4: a global, multi-ecosystem dataset and analysis of methane seasonality from freshwater wetlands</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Delwiche</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Knox</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Malhotra</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Fluet-Chouinard</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>McNicol</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Feron</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Ouyang</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Papale</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Trotta</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Canfora</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Cheah</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Christianson</last></author><author><first>Maryen</first><last>Alberto</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Alekseychik</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Aurela</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Baldocchi</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Bansal</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Billesbach</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Bohrer</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Bracho</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Buchmann</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Campbell</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Celis</last></author><author><first>Jiquan</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Weinan</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Dalmagro</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Dengel</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Desai</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Detto</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Dolman</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Eichelmann</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Famulari</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Fuchs</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Goeckede</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Gogo</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Gondwe</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Goodrich</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Gottschalk</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Graham</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Heimann</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Helfter</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Hemes</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Hirano</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Hollinger</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Hörtnagl</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Iwata</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Jacotot</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Jurasinski</last></author><author><first>Minseok</first><last>Kang</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Kasak</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>King</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Klatt</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Koebsch</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Krauss</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lai</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Lohila</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Mammarella</last></author><author><first>Luca</first><last>Belelli Marchesini</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Manca</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Matthes</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Maximov</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Merbold</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Mitra</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Morin</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Nemitz</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Nilsson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Niu</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Oechel</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Oikawa</last></author><author><first>Keisuke</first><last>Ono</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Peichl</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Peltola</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Reba</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Richardson</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Riley</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Runkle</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Ryu</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Sachs</last></author><author><first>Ayaka</first><last>Sakabe</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>R.

Methane (CH4) emissions from natural landscapes constitute
roughly half of global CH4 contributions to the atmosphere, yet large
uncertainties remain in the absolute magnitude and the seasonality of
emission quantities and drivers. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of
CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4
emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4
flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux
measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of
datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published
dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of
CH4 EC measurements (available at
https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4
includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated
CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42
freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained
ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage
globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are
freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric
CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the
seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland
CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the
freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic
attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related
parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely
cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4
emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands
(except those between 20∘ S to 20∘ N) the spring onset
of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4
emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean
annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4
emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing
increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In
contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising
CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary
productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not
correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP.
Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and
highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP
(i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource
for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and
climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites
in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added
value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021).
Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters
can be downloaded from https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/ (last access: 7 April 2021), and a complete
list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 of this paper.

Snowpack microstructure controls the transfer of heat to, and the temperature of, the underlying soils. In situ measurements of snow and soil properties from four field campaigns during two different winters (March and November 2018, January and March 2019) were compared to an ensemble of CLM5.0 (Community Land Model) simulations, at Trail Valley Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada. Snow MicroPenetrometer profiles allowed snowpack density and thermal conductivity to be derived at higher vertical resolution (1.25 mm) and a larger sample size (n = 1050) compared to traditional snowpit observations (3 cm vertical resolution; n = 115). Comparing measurements with simulations shows CLM overestimated snow thermal conductivity by a factor of 3, leading to a cold bias in wintertime soil temperatures (RMSE = 5.8 °C). Bias-correction of the simulated thermal conductivity (relative to field measurements) improved simulated soil temperatures (RMSE = 2.1 °C). Multiple linear regression shows the required correction factor is strongly related to snow depth (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.066) particularly early in the winter. Furthermore, CLM simulations did not adequately represent the observed high proportions of depth hoar. Addressing uncertainty in simulated snow properties and the corresponding heat flux is important, as wintertime soil temperatures act as a control on subnivean soil respiration, and hence impact Arctic winter carbon fluxes and budgets.

This need is particularly strong within the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Northwest Territories (NWT) Canada where permafrost peatlands are undergoing rapid thaw due to a warming climate. Current data products for predicting landscapes at risk of thaw are generally built at circumpolar scales and do not lend themselves well to fine-scale regional interpretations. Here, we present a new permafrost vulnerability dataset that assesses the degree of permafrost thaw within peatlands across a 750 km latitudinal gradient in the NWT. This updated dataset provides spatially explicit estimates of where peatland thermokarst potential exists, thus making it much more suitable for local, regional or community usage. Within southern peatland complexes, we show that permafrost thaw affects up to 70% of the peatland area and that thaw is strongly mediated by both latitude and elevation, with widespread thaw occuring particularly at low elevations. At the northern end of our latitudinal gradient, peatland permafrost remains climate-protected with relatively little thaw. Collectively these results demonstrate the importance of scale in permafrost analyses and mapping if research is to support northern communities and decision makers in a changing climate. This study offers a more scale-appropriate approach to support community adaptative planning under scenarios of continued warming and widespread permafrost thaw.</abstract><url hash="5f7c980c">2021.GWF-1.96</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/abe74b</doi><bibkey>Gibson-etal-2021-Mapping</bibkey></paper><paper id="97"><title>Predicting patterns of terrestrial lichen biomass recovery following boreal wildfires</title><author><first>Ruth</first><last>J.

Increased ﬁ re activity due to climate change may impact the successional dynamics of boreal forests, with important consequences for caribou habitat. Early successional forests have been shown to support lower quantities of caribou forage lichens, but geographic variation in, and controls on, the rates of lichen recovery has been largely unexplored. In this study, we sampled across a broad region in northwestern Canada to compare lichen biomass accumulation in ecoprovinces, including the Saskatchewan Boreal Shield, the Northwest Territories Taiga Shield, and Northwest Territories Taiga Plains, divided into North and South. We focused on the most valuable Cladonia species for boreal and barren-ground caribou: Cladonia mitis and C. arbuscula , C. rangiferina and C. stygia , and C. stellaris and C. uncialis . We developed new allometric equations to estimate lichen biomass from ﬁ eld measurements of lichen cover and height; allometries were consistent among ecoprovinces, suggesting generalizability. We then used estimates of lichen biomass to quantify patterns of lichen recovery in different stand types, ecoprovinces, and with time following stand-replacing ﬁ re. We used a hurdle model to account both for the heterogeneous nature of lichen presence (zero in ﬂ ation) and for the range of abundance in stands where lichen was present. The ﬁ rst component of the hurdle model, a generalized linear model, identi ﬁ ed stand age, stand type, and ecoprovince as signi ﬁ cant predictors of lichen presence. With a logistic growth model, a measure of lichen recovery (time to 50% asymptotic value) varied from 28 to 73 yr, dependent on stand type and ecoprovince. The combined predictions of the hurdle model suggest the most rapid recovery of lichen biomass across our study region occurred in jack pine in the Boreal Shield (30 yr), while stands located in the Taiga Plains (North and South) required a longer recovery period (approximately 75 yr).

Grounded in situ, or invasive, cosmic ray neutron sensors (CRNSs)
may allow for continuous, unattended measurements of snow water equivalent
(SWE) over complete winter seasons and allow for measurements that are
representative of spatially variable Arctic snow covers, but few studies
have tested these types of sensors or considered their applicability at
remote sites in the Arctic. During the winters of 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 we
tested a grounded in situ CRNS system at two locations in Canada: a cold,
low- to high-SWE environment in the Canadian Arctic and at a warm, low-SWE
landscape in southern Ontario that allowed easier access for validation
purposes. Five CRNS units were applied in a transect to obtain continuous
data for a single significant snow feature; CRNS-moderated
neutron counts were compared to manual snow survey SWE values obtained
during both winter seasons. The data indicate that grounded in situ CRNS
instruments appear able to continuously measure SWE with sufficient accuracy
utilizing both a linear regression and nonlinear formulation. These sensors can provide
important SWE data for testing snow and hydrological models, water resource
management applications, and the validation of remote sensing applications.

Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi‐site synthesis of how predictors of CH4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet‐based multi‐resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (e.g., seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by ~17 ± 11 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8 ± 16 and 5 ± 15 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat‐dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH4. At the diel scale, synchronous relationships with latent heat flux and vapor pressure deficit suggest that physical processes controlling evaporation and boundary layer mixing exert similar controls on CH4 volatilization, and suggest the influence of pressurized ventilation in aerenchymatous vegetation. In addition, 1‐ to 4‐h lagged relationships with ecosystem photosynthesis indicate recent carbon substrates, such as root exudates, may also control FCH4. By addressing issues of scale, asynchrony, and nonlinearity, this work improves understanding of the predictors and timing of wetland FCH4 that can inform future studies and models, and help constrain wetland CH4 emissions.</abstract><url hash="d27c293a">2021.GWF-1.101</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15661</doi><bibkey>Knox-etal-2021-Identifying</bibkey></paper><paper id="102"><title>Fill‐and‐Spill: A Process Description of Runoff Generation at the Scale of the Beholder</title><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Karran</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>V.

But to date, there has been little grouping of these process facts. Here, we discuss how the “fill‐and‐spill” concept can provide a framework to group event‐based runoff generation processes. The fill‐and‐spill concept describes where vertical and lateral additions of water to a landscape unit are placed into storage (the fill)—and only when this storage reaches a critical level (the spill), and other storages are filled and become connected, does a previously infeasible (but subsequently important) outflow pathway become activated. We show that fill‐and‐spill can be observed at a range of scales and propose that future fieldwork should first define the scale of interest and then evaluate what is filling‐and‐spilling at that scale. Such an approach may be helpful for those instrumenting and modeling new hillslopes or catchments because it provides a structured way to develop perceptual models for runoff generation and to group behaviors at different sites and scales.</abstract><url hash="4b757880">2021.GWF-1.102</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR027514</doi><bibkey>McDonnell-etal-2021-Fill‐and‐Spill:</bibkey></paper><paper id="103"><title>Catchments affect growth rate of Northern Pike, Esox lucius, in subarctic lakes</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Moslemi-Aqdam</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Low</last></author><author><first>Mike</first><last>Low</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Branfireun</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Swanson</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3c724816">2021.GWF-1.103</url><doi>10.1007/S00027-021-00817-4</doi><bibkey>Moslemi-Aqdam-etal-2021-Catchments</bibkey></paper><paper id="104"><title>A new lake classification scheme for the Peace-Athabasca Delta (Canada) characterizes hydrological processes that cause lake-level variation</title><author><first>Laura</first><last>K Neary</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Remmer</last></author><author><first>Jadine</first><last>Krist</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hall</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a216ddb5">2021.GWF-1.104</url><doi>10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100948</doi><bibkey>K Neary-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="105"><title>The Boreal–Arctic Wetland and Lake Dataset (BAWLD)</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Olefeldt</last></author><author><first>Mikael</first><last>Hovemyr</last></author><author><first>McKenzie</first><last>A.

expected to increase in response to warming and associated permafrost thaw.
However, the lack of appropriate land cover datasets for scaling
field-measured methane emissions to circumpolar scales has contributed to a
large uncertainty for our understanding of present-day and future methane
emissions. Here we present the Boreal–Arctic Wetland and Lake Dataset
(BAWLD), a land cover dataset based on an expert assessment, extrapolated
using random forest modelling from available spatial datasets of climate,
topography, soils, permafrost conditions, vegetation, wetlands, and surface
water extents and dynamics. In BAWLD, we estimate the fractional coverage of
five wetland, seven lake, and three river classes within 0.5 × 0.5∘ grid cells that cover the northern boreal and tundra biomes
(17 % of the global land surface). Land cover classes were defined using
criteria that ensured distinct methane emissions among classes, as indicated
by a co-developed comprehensive dataset of methane flux observations. In
BAWLD, wetlands occupied 3.2 × 106 km2 (14 % of domain)
with a 95 % confidence interval between 2.8 and 3.8 × 106 km2. Bog, fen, and permafrost bog were the most abundant wetland
classes, covering ∼ 28 % each of the total wetland area,
while the highest-methane-emitting marsh and tundra wetland classes occupied
5 % and 12 %, respectively. Lakes, defined to include all lentic open-water
ecosystems regardless of size, covered 1.4 × 106 km2
(6 % of domain). Low-methane-emitting large lakes (&gt;10 km2) and glacial lakes jointly represented 78 % of the total lake
area, while high-emitting peatland and yedoma lakes covered 18 % and 4 %,
respectively. Small (&lt;0.1 km2) glacial, peatland, and yedoma
lakes combined covered 17 % of the total lake area but contributed
disproportionally to the overall spatial uncertainty in lake area with a
95 % confidence interval between 0.15 and 0.38 × 106 km2. Rivers and streams were estimated to cover 0.12  × 106 km2 (0.5 % of domain), of which 8 % was associated with
high-methane-emitting headwaters that drain organic-rich landscapes.
Distinct combinations of spatially co-occurring wetland and lake classes
were identified across the BAWLD domain, allowing for the mapping of
“wetscapes” that have characteristic methane emission magnitudes and
sensitivities to climate change at regional scales. With BAWLD, we provide a
dataset which avoids double-accounting of wetland, lake, and river extents
and which includes confidence intervals for each land cover class. As such,
BAWLD will be suitable for many hydrological and biogeochemical modelling
and upscaling efforts for the northern boreal and arctic region, in
particular those aimed at improving assessments of current and future
methane emissions. Data are freely available at

One source of uncertainty is the timing and drivers of the spring transition. Remote sensing can provide important information on this transition, but persistent foliage greenness, seasonal snow cover, and a high prevalence of mixed forest stands (both deciduous and evergreen species) complicate interpretation of these signals. We collected tower‐based remotely sensed data (reflectance‐based vegetation indices and Solar‐Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence [SIF]), stem radius measurements, gross primary productivity, and environmental conditions in a boreal mixed forest stand. Evaluation of this data set shows a two‐phased spring transition. The first phase is the reactivation of photosynthesis and transpiration in evergreens, marked by an increase in relative SIF, and is triggered by thawed stems, warm air temperatures, and increased available soil moisture. The second phase is a reduction in bulk photoprotective pigments in evergreens, marked by an increase in the Chlorophyll‐Carotenoid Index. Deciduous leaf‐out occurs during this phase, marked by an increase in all remotely sensed metrics. The second phase is controlled by soil thaw. Our results demonstrate that remote sensing metrics can be used to detect specific physiological changes in boreal tree species during the spring transition. The two‐phased transition explains inconsistencies in remote sensing estimates of the timing and drivers of spring recovery. Our results imply that satellite‐based observations will improve by using a combination of vegetation indices and SIF, along with species distribution information.</abstract><url hash="3b1f8c0f">2021.GWF-1.107</url><doi>10.1029/2020JG006191</doi><bibkey>A Pierrat-etal-2021-Tower‐Based</bibkey></paper><paper id="108"><title>Game bird consumption in Dene communities of the Northwest Territories, Canada</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Ratelle</last></author><author><first>Laurie</first><last>Haig</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Laird</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Skinner</last></author><abstract>Abstract Objective: Game bird consumption is an important part of the diet of Indigenous populations in Canada and, as part of country food consumption, is associated with improved nutritional status. The objective of this project was to document the consumption of game birds for Dene First Nations in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Design: Participants were invited to complete a FFQ using an iPad to document the types of country foods consumed, as well as consumption frequency and preparation methods, including thirteen types of game birds. Setting: The project was implemented in nine communities in the Dehcho and Sahtú regions of the NWT, Canada. Participants: A total of 237 children and adult participants from Dene First Nations in the Mackenzie Valley region of the NWT took part in the current study. Results: FFQ findings indicated that game birds were frequently consumed in both Dehcho and Sahtú communities. Canada goose and mallard were found to be consumed by the largest number of participants. Five different species (including Canada goose and mallard) were found to be consumed by at least 25 % of participants over the last year. When consuming game birds, most participants reported consuming the meat as well as most, if not all, other parts of the bird. Conclusions: Differences were observed since the last country food assessment in the 1990s in the same regions. These findings increase knowledge of the current Dene diet patterns and support the understanding of diet transition.</abstract><url hash="aba0919e">2021.GWF-1.108</url><doi>10.1017/S1368980021000021</doi><bibkey>Ratelle-etal-2021-Game</bibkey></paper><paper id="109"><title>Application of artificial substrate samplers to assess enrichment of metals of concern by river floodwaters to lakes across the Peace-Athabasca Delta</title><author><first>Cory</first><last>A.

Permafrost thaw leads to thickening of the active (seasonally thawed) layer and alters nutrient and light availability. These physical changes may influence community‐level plant functional traits through intraspecific trait variation and/or species turnover. As permafrost thaw is expected to cause an efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the soil to the atmosphere, it is important to understand thaw‐induced changes in plant community productivity to evaluate whether these changes may offset some of the anticipated increases in C emissions. To this end, we collected vascular plant community composition and foliar functional trait data along gradients in aboveground tree biomass and active layer thickness (ALT) in a rapidly thawing boreal peatland, with the expectation that changes in above‐ and belowground conditions are indicative of altered resource availability. We aimed to determine whether community‐level traits vary across these gradients, and whether these changes are dominated by intraspecific trait variation, species turnover, or both. Our results highlight that variability in community‐level traits was largely attributable to species turnover and that both community composition and traits were predominantly driven by ALT. Specifically, thicker active layers associated with permafrost‐free peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens) shifted community composition from slower‐growing evergreen shrubs to faster‐growing graminoids and forbs with a corresponding shift toward more productive trait values. The results from this rapidly thawing peatland suggest that continued warming‐induced permafrost thaw and thermokarst development alter plant community composition and community‐level traits and thus ecosystem productivity. Increased productivity may help to mitigate anticipated CO2 efflux from thawing permafrost, at least in the short term, though this response may be swamped by increase CH4 release.</abstract><url hash="bc6028ed">2021.GWF-1.110</url><doi>10.1002/ece3.7818</doi><bibkey>Standen-etal-2021-Permafrost</bibkey></paper><paper id="111"><title>Statistical upscaling of ecosystem CO2 fluxes across the terrestrial tundra and boreal domain: Regional patterns and uncertainties</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Virkkala</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Aalto</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Rogers</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Tagesson</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Treat</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Natali</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Watts</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Potter</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Lehtonen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Mauritz</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Schuur</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Kochendorfer</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Zona</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Oechel</last></author><author><first>Hideki</first><last>Kobayashi</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Humphreys</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Goeckede</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Iwata</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lafleur</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Bokhorst</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Marushchak</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Martikainen</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Elberling</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Voigt</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Biasi</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Parmentier</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Ueyama</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Celis</last></author><author><first>Vincent</first><last>L St Loius</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Emmerton</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Peichl</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Chi</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Järveoja</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Nilsson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Oberbauer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Torn</last></author><author><first>Sang‐Jong</first><last>Park</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Dolman</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Mammarella</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Chae</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Poyatos</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>López-Blanco</last></author><author><first>Torben</first><last>Røjle Christensen</last></author><author><first>Min</first><last>Jung Kwon</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Sachs</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Holl</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Luoto</last></author><abstract>The regional variability in tundra and boreal carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes can be high, complicating efforts to quantify sink‐source patterns across the entire region. Statistical models are increasingly used to predict (i.e., upscale) CO2 fluxes across large spatial domains, but the reliability of different modeling techniques, each with different specifications and assumptions, has not been assessed in detail. Here, we compile eddy covariance and chamber measurements of annual and growing season CO2 fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during 1990–2015 from 148 terrestrial high‐latitude (i.e., tundra and boreal) sites to analyze the spatial patterns and drivers of CO2 fluxes and test the accuracy and uncertainty of different statistical models. CO2 fluxes were upscaled at relatively high spatial resolution (1 km2) across the high‐latitude region using five commonly used statistical models and their ensemble, that is, the median of all five models, using climatic, vegetation, and soil predictors. We found the performance of machine learning and ensemble predictions to outperform traditional regression methods. We also found the predictive performance of NEE‐focused models to be low, relative to models predicting GPP and ER. Our data compilation and ensemble predictions showed that CO2 sink strength was larger in the boreal biome (observed and predicted average annual NEE −46 and −29 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively) compared to tundra (average annual NEE +10 and −2 g C m−2 yr−1). This pattern was associated with large spatial variability, reflecting local heterogeneity in soil organic carbon stocks, climate, and vegetation productivity. The terrestrial ecosystem CO2 budget, estimated using the annual NEE ensemble prediction, suggests the high‐latitude region was on average an annual CO2 sink during 1990–2015, although uncertainty remains high.</abstract><url hash="cb67187b">2021.GWF-1.111</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.15659</doi><bibkey>Virkkala-etal-2021-Statistical</bibkey></paper><paper id="112"><title>Soil respiration strongly offsets carbon uptake in Alaska and Northwest Canada</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Watts</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Natali</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Minions</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Risk</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Arndt</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Zona</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Rocha</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Kalhori</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Oechel</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Ikawa</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Ueyama</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Suzuki</last></author><author><first>Hideki</first><last>Kobayashi</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Celis</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Schuur</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Humphreys</last></author><author><first>Yongwon</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Goetz</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Madani</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Schiferl</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Commane</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Kimball</last></author><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Torn</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Potter</last></author><author><first>Jonathan</first><last>A.

To address this knowledge gap, we first compiled a new CO2 flux database for permafrost-affected tundra and boreal ecosystems in Alaska and Northwest Canada. We then used the CO2 database, multi-sensor satellite imagery, and random forest models to assess the regional magnitude of soil respiration. The flux database includes a new Soil Respiration Station network of chamber-based fluxes, and fluxes from eddy covariance towers. Our site-level data, spanning September 2016 to August 2017, revealed that the largest soil respiration emissions occurred during the summer (June–August) and that summer fluxes were higher in boreal sites (1.87 ± 0.67 g CO2–C m−2 d−1) relative to tundra (0.94 ± 0.4 g CO2–C m−2 d−1). We also observed considerable emissions (boreal: 0.24 ± 0.2 g CO2–C m−2 d−1; tundra: 0.18 ± 0.16 g CO2–C m−2 d−1) from soils during the winter (November–March) despite frozen surface conditions. Our model estimates indicated an annual region-wide loss from soil respiration of 591 ± 120 Tg CO2–C during the 2016–2017 period. Summer months contributed to 58% of the regional soil respiration, winter months contributed to 15%, and the shoulder months contributed to 27%. In total, soil respiration offset 54% of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) across the study domain. We also found that in tundra environments, transitional tundra/boreal ecotones, and in landscapes recently affected by fire, soil respiration often exceeded GPP, resulting in a net annual source of CO2 to the atmosphere. As this region continues to warm, soil respiration may increasingly offset GPP, further amplifying global climate change.</abstract><url hash="526e49c1">2021.GWF-1.112</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac1222</doi><bibkey>Watts-etal-2021-Soil</bibkey></paper><paper id="113"><title>Widespread decline in winds delayed autumn foliar senescence over high latitudes</title><author><first>Chaoyang</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>Jian</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Ciais</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Peñuelas</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyang</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>Fengli</first><last>Tian</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyue</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Huanjiong</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Ronggao</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Yongshuo</first><last>H.

Using ground observations, flux measurements, and remote sensing imagery, here we show that decline in winds significantly extended DFS over high latitudes at a magnitude comparable with the temperature and precipitation effects. We found that decline in winds reduces evapotranspiration, causes fewer damaging effects, and also results in decreased cooling effect. Our results therefore are of great significance for carbon cycle modeling because an improved algorithm based on these findings projected overall widespread earlier DFS by the end of this century, contributing potentially to a positive feedback to climate. The high northern latitudes (&gt;50°) experienced a pronounced surface stilling (i.e., decline in winds) with climate change. As a drying factor, the influences of changes in winds on the date of autumn foliar senescence (DFS) remain largely unknown and are potentially important as a mechanism explaining the interannual variability of autumn phenology. Using 183,448 phenological observations at 2,405 sites, long-term site-scale water vapor and carbon dioxide flux measurements, and 34 y of satellite greenness data, here we show that the decline in winds is significantly associated with extended DFS and could have a relative importance comparable with temperature and precipitation effects in contributing to the DFS trends. We further demonstrate that decline in winds reduces evapotranspiration, which results in less soil water losses and consequently more favorable growth conditions in late autumn. In addition, declining winds also lead to less leaf abscission damage which could delay leaf senescence and to a decreased cooling effect and therefore less frost damage. Our results are potentially useful for carbon flux modeling because an improved algorithm based on these findings projected overall widespread earlier DFS than currently expected by the end of this century, contributing potentially to a positive feedback to climate.</abstract><url hash="25697957">2021.GWF-1.113</url><doi>10.1073/pnas.2015821118</doi><bibkey>Wu-etal-2021-Widespread</bibkey></paper><paper id="114"><title>Determining the role of diffusion and basement flux in controlling 4He distribution in sedimentary basin fluids</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Cheng</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Sherwood Lollar</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Warr</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Idiz</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Mundle</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Barry</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Byrne</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Mabry</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Ballentine</last></author><abstract /><url hash="bb0decf4">2021.GWF-1.114</url><doi>10.1016/j.epsl.2021.117175</doi><bibkey>Cheng-etal-2021-Determining</bibkey></paper><paper id="115"><title>The hidden crisis beneath our feet</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>Disappearing groundwater requires action to prevent widespread water scarcity Most of the world's unfrozen freshwater is invisible to humanity.

Here, we estimate the amount of groundwater present in the upper 10 km of the Earth's continental crust by examining the distribution of sedimentary and crystalline rocks with depth and applying porosity‐depth relationships. We demonstrate that groundwater in the 2–10 km zone (what we call “deep groundwater”) has a volume comparable to that of groundwater in the upper 2 km of the Earth's crust. These new estimates make groundwater the largest continental reservoir of water, ahead of ice sheets, provide a basis to quantify geochemical cycles, and constrain the potential for large‐scale isolation of waste fluids.</abstract><url hash="55038dd8">2021.GWF-1.116</url><doi>10.1029/2021GL093549</doi><bibkey>Ferguson-etal-2021-Crustal</bibkey></paper><paper id="117"><title>Variability in Timing and Transport of Pleistocene Meltwater Recharge to Regional Aquifers</title><author><first>Aidan</first><last>C.

We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of recharge events from glaciations over the last 2 million years in the Williston Basin, Canada. Integration of fluid chemistry, stable isotope data, and transport modeling indicate that meltwater arrived at depths of ∼600–1000 m in the northcentral region of the Williston Basin at two separate time periods, 75–150 and 300 ka, which we attribute to permeability differences between stacked aquifer systems. Our findings indicate that meltwater recharge extended along the northern margin of the Williston Basin as well as previously identified recharge areas to the east.

This potential for upward fluid migration is largely unquantified as monitoring abandoned wells is rarely done, and leakage may go unnoticed especially when in deeper aquifers. This study performs a proximity analysis between old abandoned wells and HF, EOR, and SWD wells, and identifies commingled old abandoned wellbores, which are those wells where groundwater may flow from one aquifer to one or more other aquifers, to identify the locations with the greatest potential for upward aqueous fluid migration at three study sites in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Our analysis indicates that at all three study sites there are several locations where HF, EOR, or SWD operations are located in close proximity to a given old abandoned well. Much of this overlap occurs in formations above typically produced hydrocarbon reservoirs but below exploited potable aquifers, otherwise known as the intermediate zone, which is often connected between abandonment plugs in old abandoned wells. Information on the intermediate zone is often lacking, and this study suggests that unanticipated alterations to groundwater flow systems within the intermediate zone may be occurring. Results indicate the need for more field‐based research on the intermediate zone.</abstract><url hash="b2bba0df">2021.GWF-1.118</url><doi>10.1111/gwat.13140</doi><bibkey>Perra-etal-2021-Commingled</bibkey></paper><paper id="119"><title>Assessing Extremes in Hydroclimatology: A Review on Probabilistic Methods</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Nerantzaki</last></author><author><first>Simon</first><last>Michael Papalexiou</last></author><abstract /><url hash="c5bc9049">2021.GWF-1.119</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127302</doi><bibkey>Nerantzaki-etal-2021-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="120"><title>Advancing Space‐Time Simulation of Random Fields: From Storms to Cyclones and Beyond</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Serinaldi</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Porcu</last></author><abstract>Realistic stochastic simulation of hydro‐environmental fluxes in space and time, such as rainfall, is challenging yet of paramount importance to inform environmental risk analysis and decision making under uncertainty. Here, we advance random fields simulation by introducing the concepts of general velocity fields and general anisotropy transformations. This expands the capabilities of the so‐called Complete Stochastic Modeling Solution (CoSMoS) framework enabling the simulation of random fields (RF's) preserving: (a) any non‐Gaussian marginal distribution, (b) any spatiotemporal correlation structure (STCS), (c) general advection expressed by velocity fields with locally varying speed and direction, and (d) locally varying anisotropy. We also introduce new copula‐based STCS's and provide conditions guaranteeing their positive definiteness. To illustrate the potential of CoSMoS, we simulate RF's with complex patterns and motion mimicking rainfall storms moving across an area, spiraling fields resembling weather cyclones, fields converging to (or diverging from) a point, and colliding air masses.

Accurate monitoring of the residual free chlorine concentration in water cycles is critical to maintain public health safety. Here, we report on a thin gold film-based reusable and reagent-less free chlorine sensor. A gold thin film of 300 nm thickness was deposited on a polyimide tape, which was placed on a glass substrate and a simple Styrofoam adhesive tape was used to cover the film and expose 0.36 cm2 circular area as the sensing surface. The sensor showed a high sensitivity of 0.327 μA ppm-1, with a linear range of 0 to 6 ppm, and an accuracy of &lt;0.1 ppm with high selectivity in the presence of commonly interfering ions. The sensor response time was 50 s with a negligible hysteresis of 0.06 ppm. The sensor showed very little change in output current in the pH range between 5.2 to 8.4, and temperature range of 20 to 30 °C. Therefore, the sensor operation is reagent-less, does not need frequent calibration, and showed consistent sensing performance with real water samples. The simple fabrication, ease-of-use and reliable sensing performance of the proposed sensor shows feasibility for mass-production and application in remote and resource-limited areas.</abstract><url hash="0e442a94">2021.GWF-1.123</url><doi>10.1039/d1an00038a</doi><bibkey>Ul Alam-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="124"><title>Fruit Quality Monitoring with Smart Packaging</title><author><first>Arif</first><last>Ul Alam</last></author><author><first>Pranali</first><last>Rathi</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Beshai</last></author><author><first>Gursimran</first><last>K.

Smart packaging systems also help to prolong the shelf life of perishable foods during transport and mass storage, which are difficult to regulate otherwise. The use of these ever-progressing technologies in the packaging of fruits has the potential to result in many positive consequences, including improved fruit quality, reduced waste, and associated improved public health. In this review, we examine the role of smart packaging in fruit packaging, current-state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects. First, we discuss the motivation behind fruit quality monitoring and maintenance, followed by the background on the development process of fruits, factors used in determining fruit quality, and the classification of smart packaging technologies. Then, we discuss conventional freshness sensors for packaged fruits including direct and indirect freshness indicators. After that, we provide examples of possible smart packaging systems and sensors that can be used in monitoring fruits quality, followed by several strategies to mitigate premature fruit decay, and active packaging technologies. Finally, we discuss the prospects of smart packaging application for fruit quality monitoring along with the associated challenges and prospects.</abstract><url hash="9020bf37">2021.GWF-1.124</url><doi>10.3390/s21041509</doi><bibkey>Ul Alam-etal-2021-Fruit</bibkey></paper><paper id="125"><title>Integrated Microfluidic-Based Platforms for On-Site Detection and Quantification of Infectious Pathogens: Towards On-Site Medical Translation of SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Platforms</title><author><first>Andres</first><last>Escobar</last></author><author><first>Phyllis</first><last>Chiu</last></author><author><first>Jianxi</first><last>Qu</last></author><author><first>Yushan</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Chang-Qing</first><last>Xu</last></author><abstract>The rapid detection and quantification of infectious pathogens is an essential component to the control of potentially lethal outbreaks among human populations worldwide. Several of these highly infectious pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been cemented in human history as causing epidemics or pandemics due to their lethality and contagiousness. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of these highly infectious pathogens that have recently become one of the leading causes of globally reported deaths, creating one of the worst economic downturns and health crises in the last century. As a result, the necessity for highly accurate and increasingly rapid on-site diagnostic platforms for highly infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically over the last two years. Current conventional non-microfluidic diagnostic techniques have limitations in their effectiveness as on-site devices due to their large turnaround times, operational costs and the need for laboratory equipment. In this review, we first present criteria, both novel and previously determined, as a foundation for the development of effective and viable on-site microfluidic diagnostic platforms for several notable pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. This list of criteria includes standards that were set out by the WHO, as well as our own “seven pillars” for effective microfluidic integration. We then evaluate the use of microfluidic integration to improve upon currently, and previously, existing platforms for the detection of infectious pathogens. Finally, we discuss a stage-wise means to translate our findings into a fundamental framework towards the development of more effective on-site SARS-CoV-2 microfluidic-integrated platforms that may facilitate future pandemic diagnostic and research endeavors. Through microfluidic integration, many limitations in currently existing infectious pathogen diagnostic platforms can be eliminated or improved upon.</abstract><url hash="e7278fa1">2021.GWF-1.125</url><doi>10.3390/mi12091079</doi><bibkey>Escobar-etal-2021-Integrated</bibkey></paper><paper id="126"><title>Critical review of bio/nano sensors for arsenic detection</title><author><first>Chenghua</first><last>Zong</last></author><author><first>Xiaoting</first><last>Jin</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7e2ede1b">2021.GWF-1.126</url><doi>10.1016/J.TEAC.2021.E00143</doi><bibkey>Zong-etal-2021-Critical</bibkey></paper><paper id="127"><title>Facile fabrication of conductive MoS2 thin films by sonication in hot water and evaluation of their electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Saha</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Patel</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kruse</last></author><abstract>Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has long been used in catalysis and is a promising material for energy conversion devices. In order to utilize MoS2 in electrocatalytic applications, it needs to be sufficiently conductive. Even though a metallic 1T phase of MoS2 exists, its exfoliation process is expensive and difficult to scale because it involves hazardous materials and procedures, limiting its practical applications. We have previously reported an efficient and environmentally friendly procedure to exfoliate conductive MoS2via sonication in very dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Here, we report a new way of exfoliating heavily doped conductive MoS2 by sonication in pure water at 60 °C without additives. Conductivity measurements, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that controlling the sonication time and temperature lead to the generation of small quantities of hydrogen peroxide in the water that interact with MoS2 to form a small amount of sub-stoichiometric MoO3−y. This impurity acts as a dopant and is responsible for the increase in conductivity of the MoS2 films without compromising their structural integrity. We also evaluate the performance of the doped MoS2 films as electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction. We elucidate the mechanistic origin of the catalytic properties of these materials which may be of future use to develop a family of electrocatalysts based on doped MoS2.</abstract><url hash="0929ee8d">2021.GWF-1.127</url><doi>10.1039/d1na00456e</doi><bibkey>Saha-etal-2021-Facile</bibkey></paper><paper id="128"><title>Investigating the stability of electrically conductive membranes</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Halali</last></author><author><first>Melissa</first><last>J.

This paper reports the use of pencil graphite as an electrode for dual applications that include the detection of free residual chlorine using electro-oxidation process and as an electrochemical energy storage cathode. The pencil graphite is transferred to cellulose paper by drawing ten times and applied for the detection of free residual chlorine, which shows a sensitivity of 27 μA mM-1 cm-2 with a limit of detection of 88.9 μM and linearity up to 7 mM. The sample matrix effect study for the commonly interfering ions such as NO3-, SO42-, CO32-, Cl-, HCO3- shows minimal impact on free residual chlorine detection. Pencil graphite then used after cyclic voltammogram treatment as a cathode in the aqueous Zn/Al-ion battery, showing an average discharge potential plateau of ~1.1 V, with a specific cathode capacity of ~54.1 mAh g-1 at a current of 55 mA g-1. It maintains ~95.8% of its initial efficiency after 100 cycles. Results obtained from the density functional theory calculation is consistent with the electro-oxidation process involved in the detection of free residual chlorine, as well as intercalation and de-intercalation behavior of Al3+ into the graphite layers of Zn/Al-ion battery. Therefore, pencil graphite due to its excellent electro-oxidation and conducting properties, can be successfully implemented as low cost, disposable and green material for both sensor and energy-storage applications.</abstract><url hash="ee91c38a">2021.GWF-1.129</url><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0248142</doi><bibkey>Islam-etal-2021-Pencil</bibkey></paper><paper id="130"><title>A Microflow Cytometry-Based Agglutination Immunoassay for Point-of-Care Quantitative Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG</title><author><first>Jianxi</first><last>Qu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Chenier</last></author><author><first>Yushan</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Chang-Qing</first><last>Xu</last></author><abstract>A rapid, sensitive and simple microflow cytometry-based agglutination immunoassay (MCIA) was developed for point-of-care (POC) quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies.

In this study, the metal-phosphate interaction is probed to understand the trend of activity with different metal ions. For the first-row transition metals, the lowest activity shown by Ni2+ correlates with the inhibition by the inorganic phosphate and its water ligand exchange rate, suggesting inner-sphere metal coordination. Cleavage activity with the two stereoisomers of the phosphorothioate-modified substrates, Rp and Sp, indicated that Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ had the highest Sp:Rp activity ratio of &gt;900. Comparatively, the activity was much less affected using the thiophilic metals, including Pb2+, suggesting inner-sphere coordination. The pH-rate profiles showed that Pb2+ was different than the rest of the metal ions in having a smaller slope and a similar fitted apparent pKa and the pKa of metal-bound water. Combining previous reports and our current results, we propose that Pb2+ most likely plays the role of a general acid while the other metal ions are Lewis acid catalysts interacting with the scissile phosphate.</abstract><url hash="fe3cbee0">2021.GWF-1.135</url><doi>10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00091</doi><bibkey>J.

Therefore, any mischaracterization of surface roughness parameters (root mean square height, RMSH, and correlation length, ʅ) may result in unreliable predictions and soil moisture estimations. In many environments, but particularly in agricultural settings, surface roughness parameters may show different behaviours with respect to the orientation or azimuth. Consequently, the relationship between SAR polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters may vary depending on measurement orientation. Generally, roughness obtained for many SAR-based studies is estimated using pin profilers that may, or may not, be collected with careful attention to orientation to the satellite look angle. In this study, we characterized surface roughness parameters in multi-azimuth mode using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). We characterized the surface roughness parameters in different orientations and then examined the sensitivity between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters; further, we compared these results to roughness profiles obtained using traditional pin profilers. The results showed that the polarimetric variables were more sensitive to the surface roughness parameters at higher incidence angles (θ). Moreover, when surface roughness measurements were conducted at the look angle of RADARSAT-2, more significant correlations were observed between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters. Our results also indicated that TLS can represent more reliable results than pin profiler in the measurement of the surface roughness parameters.</abstract><url hash="1032dfcc">2021.GWF-1.137</url><doi>10.3390/rs13112210</doi><bibkey>Alijani-etal-2021-Sensitivity</bibkey></paper><paper id="138"><title>Synthesis of science: findings on Canadian Prairie wetland drainage</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>Jared</first><last>D.

Existing correction approaches to brightness temperatures for northern boreal forest regions consider forest transmissivity constant during wintertime. However, due to biophysical protection mechanisms, below freezing air temperatures freeze the water content of northern tree species only gradually. As a consequence, the permittivity of many northern tree species decreases with the decrease of air temperature under sub-zero temperature conditions. This results in a monotonic increase of the tree vegetation transmissivity, as the permittivity contrast to the surrounding air decreases. The influence of this tree temperature-transmissivity relationship on the performance of the frequency difference passive microwave snow retrieval algorithms has not been considered. Using ground-based observations and an analytical model simulation based on Mätzler’s approach (1994), the influence of the temperature-transmissivity relationship on the snow retrieval algorithms, based on the spectral difference of two microwave channels, is characterized. A simple approximation approach is then developed to successfully characterize this influence (the RMSE between the analytical model simulation and the approximation approach estimation is below 0.3 K). The approximation is applied to spaceborne observations, and demonstrates the capacity to reduce the influence of the forest temperature-transmissivity relationship on passive microwave frequency difference brightness temperature.</abstract><url hash="f78af2cb">2021.GWF-1.139</url><doi>10.1080/17538947.2021.1950852</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="140"><title>Implications of measurement metrics on soil freezing curves: A simulation of freeze–thaw hysteresis</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Pardo Lara</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Warland</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Parkin</last></author><abstract>Soil freeze–thaw events have important implications for water resources, flood risk, land productivity, and climate change. A property of these phenomena is the relationship between unfrozen water content and sub‐freezing temperature, known as the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC). It is documented that this relationship exhibits hysteretic behaviour when frozen soil thaws, leading to the definition of the soil thawing characteristic curve (STC). Although explanations have been given for SFC/STC hysteresis, the effect that ‘scale’ – particularly ‘measurement scale’ – may have on these curves has received little attention. The most commonly used measurement scale metric is the ‘support’, which is the spatial (or temporal) unit within which the measured variable is integrated or soil volume sampled. We show (a) measurement support can influence the range and shape of the SFC and (b) hysteresis can be attributed, in part, to the support and location of the measurements comprising the SFC/STC. We simulated lab measured temperature, volumetric water content (VWC), and permittivity from soil samples undergoing freeze–thaw transitions using Hydrus‐1D and a modified Dobson permittivity model. To assess the effect of measurement support and location on SFC/STC, we masked the simulated temperature and VWC/permittivity extent to match the instrument's support and location. By creating a detailed simulation of the intra‐ and inter‐support variability associated with the penetration of a freezing front, we demonstrate how measurement support and location can influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured. We show it is possible to simulate hysteresis in homogenous media with purely geometric considerations, suggesting that SFC/STC hysteresis may be more of an apparent phenomenon than mechanistically real. Lastly, we develop an understanding of how the location and support of soil temperature and VWC/permittivity measurements influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured.</abstract><url hash="c117dca8">2021.GWF-1.140</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14269</doi><bibkey>Pardo Lara-etal-2021-Implications</bibkey></paper><paper id="141"><title>Estimating wind slab thickness in a Tundra snowpack using Ku-band scatterometer observations</title><author><first>Aaron</first><last>F.

The snow in much of this region is described as tundra, comprised of wind slab and depth hoar. Recent work in tundra environments has identified the potential of wind slab to limit radar sensitivity to SWE at 17.2 GHz, which has negative implications for SWE retrievals and demonstrates a need to constrain retrieval parameters. Radar measurements at 17.2 GHz were made in Trail Valley Creek using the University of Waterloo Scatterometer (UWScat), and combined with the Freeman-Durden polarimetric decomposition to address this need by introducing a novel relationship between wind slab thickness and double-bounce scattering, which can be used to constrain wind slab thickness. The relationship strengthens with path length through wind slab and was strong at incidence angles ≥ 46° and wind slab with thickness ≥ 19 cm. Wind slab thickness and SWE were estimated with an RMSE of 6.0 cm and 5.5 mm, respectively. This relationship is valid for use in tundra snow with depth hoar. More testing is recommended to determine the maximum detectable wind slab thickness.</abstract><url hash="b610ec3e">2021.GWF-1.141</url><doi>10.1080/2150704X.2021.1961174</doi><bibkey>F.

The mid-latitudes provide opportunity to understand the influence on SWE retrievals of ice and vegetation, conditions which may encroach the north with a warming climate. Successful retrieval of SWE and snow depth was demonstrated using the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks, adapted for backscattering (MEMLS3&amp;a) with multi-angle Ku-band UWScat snow observations (VV polarization), of agricultural fields in Maryhill and Englehart, Ontario. A single-layer parameterization provided best results for Maryhill (RMSE of 21.9 mm SWE) while a dual-layer parameterization provided best results for Englehart (RMSE of 24.6 mm). Accounting for soil effects using a soil-subtraction method improved RMSE by up to 6.3 mm SWE. Retrievals were repeated with in situ snow depths improving accuracy at both sites (RMSE = 12.0 and 10.9 mm SWE for Maryhill and Englehart, respectively). Observations containing ice lenses and partially buried vegetation yielded a retrieval accuracy of RMSE = 60.4 mm which improved with in situ snow depths (RMSE = 21.1 mm SWE).

Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 million square km of Earth's surface (31 % of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression of and driver of the Earth’s climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (~ −13 %/decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world’s population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth’s cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of snow stored on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations will not be able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high socio-economic value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimetre-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modelling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, densities, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and applications communities on progress made in recent decades, and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote-sensing from SAR measurements.

The vulnerability of public supply wells to water quality degradation may temporarily increase during these types of events. The Walkerton, ON, Canada, tragedy (2000) highlighted the threat to human health associated with the rapid transport of microbial pathogens to public supply wells during dynamic recharge events. Field research at the Thornton (Woodstock, ON, Canada) and Mannheim West (Kitchener, ON, Canada) well fields, situated in glacial overburden aquifers, identified a potential increase in vulnerability due to event-based recharge phenomena. Ephemeral surface water flow and local ponding containing microbial pathogen indicator species were observed and monitored within the capture zones of public supply wells following heavy rain and/or snowmelt. Elevated recharge rates beneath these temporary surface water features were estimated to range between 40 and 710 mm over two-week periods using analytical and numerical modelling based on the water level, soil moisture, and temperature data. Modelling also suggested that such events could reduce contaminant travel times to a supply well, increasing vulnerability to water quality degradation. These studies suggest that event-based recharge processes occurring close to public supply wells may enhance the vulnerability of the wells to surface-sourced contaminants.</abstract><url hash="c67a18b1">2021.GWF-1.144</url><doi>10.3390/SU13147695</doi><bibkey>J.

Warmer winters are associated with shorter periods of snow cover, resulting in more frequent and extensive soil freezing and thawing. Freeze-thaw cycles influence soil chemical, biological, and physical properties and any changes to winter soil processes may impact carbon and nutrients export from affected soils, possibly altering soil health and nearby water quality. These impacts are relevant for agricultural soils and practices in cold regions as they are critical in governing water flows and quality within agroecosystems. In this study, a soil column experiment was conducted to assess the leaching of nutrients from fertilized agricultural soil during the non-growing season. Four soil columns were exposed to a non-growing season temperature and precipitation model and fertilizer amendments were made to two of the columns to determine the efficacy of fall-applied fertilizers and compared to other two unfertilized control columns. Leachates from the soil columns were collected and analyzed for cations and anions. The experiment results showed that a transition from a freeze period to a thaw period resulted in significant loss of chloride (Cl-), sulfate (SO42-) and nitrate (NO3-). Even with low NO3- concentrations in the applied artificial rainwater and fertilizer, high NO3- concentrations (~150 mg l-1) were observed in fertilized column leachates. Simple plug flow reactor model results indicate the high NO3- leachates are found to be due to active nitrification occurring in the upper oxidized portion of the soil columns mimicking overwinter NO3- losses via nitrification in agricultural fields. The low NO3- leachates in unfertilized columns suggest that freeze-thaw cycling had little effect on N mineralization in soil. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to bolster winter soil biogeochemical models by elucidating nutrient fluxes over changing winter conditions to refine best management practices for fertilizer application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract><url hash="b17d2827">2021.GWF-1.145</url><doi>10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13853</doi><bibkey>Krogstad-etal-2021-Impact</bibkey></paper><paper id="146"><title>Non-uniform growth dynamics of a dominant boreal tree species (Picea mariana) in the face of rapid climate change</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Sniderhan</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Mamet</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Northwestern Canada’s boreal forest has experienced rapid warming, drying, and changes to permafrost, yet the growth responses and mechanisms driving productivity have been under-studied at broad scales. Forest responses are largely driven by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) — the region’s most widespread and dominant tree. We collected tree ring samples from four black spruce-dominated sites across 15° of latitude, spanning gradients in climate and permafrost. We investigated (i) differences in growth patterns, (ii) variations in climatic drivers of growth, and (iii) trends in water use efficiency (WUE) through 13C isotope analysis from 1945 to 2006. We found positive growth trends at all sites except those at mid-latitude, where rapid permafrost thaw drove declines. Annual growth was lowest at the tree limit site and highest at the tree line. Climatic drivers of these growth patterns varied; positive growth responses at the northerly sites were associated with warmer winters, whereas Δ13C trends and climate-growth responses at mid-latitude sites indicated that growth was limited by moisture availability. Δ13C signatures indicated increased WUE at the southernmost site, with no significant trends at northern sites. These results suggest that warming will increase the growth of trees at the northern extent of black spruce, but southerly areas may face drought stress if precipitation does not balance evapotranspiration.</abstract><url hash="2874799d">2021.GWF-1.146</url><doi>10.1139/cjfr-2020-0188</doi><bibkey>Sniderhan-etal-2021-Non-uniform</bibkey></paper><paper id="147"><title>On estimating long period wind speed return levels from annual maxima</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Ben Alaya</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="5f73490b">2021.GWF-1.147</url><doi>10.1016/j.wace.2021.100388</doi><bibkey>Ben Alaya-etal-2021-On</bibkey></paper><paper id="148"><title>Reduction in autumn precipitation over Southwest China by anthropogenic aerosol emissions from eastern China</title><author><first>Fei</first><last>Huo</last></author><author><first>Zhihong</first><last>Jiang</last></author><author><first>Hongyun</first><last>Ma</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract /><url hash="cfcc549a">2021.GWF-1.148</url><doi>10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2021.105627</doi><bibkey>Huo-etal-2021-Reduction</bibkey></paper><paper id="149"><title>Changes in freezing rain occurrence over eastern Canada using convection-permitting climate simulations</title><author><first>Sébastien</first><last>Marinier</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Ikeda</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b8cb640c">2021.GWF-1.149</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-022-06370-6</doi><bibkey>Marinier-etal-2021-Changes</bibkey></paper><paper id="150"><title>Climate Model Projections for Canada: A Comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Sobie</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Curry</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT Recent studies have identified stronger warming in the latest generation of climate model simulations globally, and the same is true for projected changes in Canada. This study examines differences for Canada and six sub-regions between simulations from the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and its predecessor CMIP5. Ensembles from both experiments are assessed using a set of derived indices calculated from daily precipitation and temperature, with projections compared at fixed future time intervals and fixed levels of global temperature change. For changes calculated at fixed time intervals most temperature indices display higher projected changes in CMIP6 than CMIP5 for most sub-regions, while greater precipitation changes in CMIP6 occur mainly in extreme precipitation indices. When future projections are calculated at fixed levels of global average temperature increase, the size and spread of differences for future projected changes between CMIP6 and CMIP5 are substantially reduced for most indices. Temperature scaling behaviour, or the regional response to increasing global temperatures, is similar in both ensembles, with annual temperature anomalies for Canada and its sub-regions increasing at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the rate of increase globally, depending on the region. The CMIP6 ensemble projections exhibit modestly stronger scaling behaviour for temperature anomalies in northern Canada, as well as for certain indices of moderate and extreme events. Such temperature scaling differences persist even if anomalously warm CMIP6 global climate models are omitted. Comparing the mean and variance of future projections for Canada in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations from the same modelling centre suggests CMIP6 models are significantly warmer in Canada than CMIP5 models at the same level of forcing, with some evidence that internal temperature variability in CMIP6 is reduced compared with CMIP5.</abstract><url hash="d80cede9">2021.GWF-1.150</url><doi>10.1080/07055900.2021.2011103</doi><bibkey>Sobie-etal-2021-Climate</bibkey></paper><paper id="151"><title>Hydrological evaluation of high-resolution precipitation estimates from the WRF model in the Third Pole river basins</title><author><first>He</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Su</last></author><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>He</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Ou</last></author><author><first>Deliang</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>1 Hydrological evaluation of high-resolution precipitation estimates from the WRF 1 model in the Third Pole river basins 2 He Sun, Fengge Su, Zhihua He, Tinghai Ou, Deliang Chen, Zhenhua Li, 3 Yanping Li 4 5 Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, 6 Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, 7 China 8 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China 9 CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing 100101, China 10 Centre for Hydrology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 11 1K2, Canada 12 Regional Climate Group, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Gothenburg, 13 Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden 14 15 Corresponding author: Fengge Su 16 Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, 17 Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS, Beijing, 100101, China 18 Email: fgsu@itpcas.ac.cn 19 Phone: +86[10]84097074 20 Fax: +86[10] 84097079 21</abstract><url hash="af0bdd7f">2021.GWF-1.151</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-20-0272.1</doi><bibkey>Sun-etal-2021-Hydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="152"><title>Assessing past and future hazardous freezing rain and wet snow events in Manitoba, Canada using a pseudo-global warming approach</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Tropea</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><abstract /><url hash="36028cc5">2021.GWF-1.152</url><doi>10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2021.105656</doi><bibkey>Tropea-etal-2021-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="153"><title>On the Optimal Design of Field Significance Tests for Changes in Climate Extremes</title><author><first>Jianyu</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Chao</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Guilong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Zhihong</first><last>Jiang</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Zhai</last></author><author><first>Ying</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Zhen</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Yue</last></author><abstract>Field significance tests have been widely used to detect climate change. In most cases, a local test is used to identify significant changes at individual locations, which is then followed by a field significance test that considers the number of locations in a region with locally significant changes. The choice of local test can affect the result, potentially leading to conflicting assessments of the impact of climate change on a region. We demonstrate that when considering changes in the annual extremes of daily precipitation, the simple Mann‐Kendall trend test is preferred as the local test over more complex likelihood ratio tests that compare the fits of stationary and nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions. This lesson allows us to report, with enhanced confidence, that the intensification of annual extremes of daily precipitation in China since 1961 became field significant much earlier than previously reported.</abstract><url hash="4105bc53">2021.GWF-1.153</url><doi>10.1029/2021GL092831</doi><bibkey>Wang-etal-2021-On</bibkey></paper><paper id="154"><title>A Frequency-Domain Optofluidic Dissolved Oxygen Sensor With Total Internal Reflection Design For in Situ Monitoring</title><author><first>Bo</first><last>Xiong</last></author><author><first>Eric</first><last>Mahoney</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Lo</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Fang</last></author><abstract>Continuous measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO) variation is important in water monitoring and biomedical applications, which require low-cost and low-maintenance sensors capable of automated operation. A frequency-domain optofluidic DO sensor with total internal reflection (TIR) design has been developed based on fluorescence quenching of Ruthenium complex (Ru(dpp)3Cl2). To minimize artifacts causing drift in fluorescence measurements such as background autofluorescence, photobleaching, optical alignment variation, a low-cost frequency-domain approach is implemented in an optofluidic platform to measure the phase shift between the excitation and emission light. We show that the frequency domain optofluidic DO sensor provides absolute DO concentrations in repeated measurements. TIR design can enhance fluorescence signal in the integrated device and minimize background autofluorescence in the sample, which can subsequently improve overall sensitivity. Furthermore, photobleaching in the samples would be mitigated as the incident light does not enter the microfluidic channel. Our results demonstrate a measurement resolution of 0.2 ppm and response times of less than one minute. In accelerated photobleaching conditions, the long-term drift is shown to be less than ±0.4 ppm. These results suggest the potential of this optofluidic DO sensor as an in situ platform for water monitoring and biomedical applications.</abstract><url hash="df6129f0">2021.GWF-1.154</url><doi>10.1109/JSTQE.2020.2997810</doi><bibkey>Xiong-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="155"><title>Dual-Modality Imaging Microfluidic Cytometer for Onsite Detection of Phytoplankton</title><author><first>Bo</first><last>Xiong</last></author><author><first>Tianqi</first><last>Hong</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Schellhorn</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Fang</last></author><abstract>Phytoplankton monitoring is essential for better understanding and mitigation of phytoplankton bloom formation.

This reduction, however, encouraged the expansion of irrigation, which may rebound agricultural water demands. This paradox requires an understanding of human adaptation to drought by mapping individual farmers’ water conservation decisions to the dynamics of the basin-wide water demand. We develop an agent-based agricultural water demand (ABAD) model, simulating farmers’ behavior in adopting new on-farm irrigation systems and/or changing crop patterns in response to drought conditions in the BRB. ABAD demonstrates (1) how farmers’ attitude toward profits, risk aversion, environmental protection, social interaction, and irrigation expansion explains the dynamics of the water demand and (2) how the conservation program may paradoxically lead to the rebound phenomenon. ABAD, subject to its conceptualization limitations, can be used for exploration and scenario analysis of future agricultural water demand in response to water conservation programs in the BRB.</abstract><url hash="4668784a">2021.GWF-1.157</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2021.1873344</doi><bibkey>Ghoreishi-etal-2021-Understanding</bibkey></paper><paper id="158"><title>Peering into agricultural rebound phenomenon using a global sensitivity analysis approach</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Ghoreishi</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Elshorbagy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Belcher</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d6d765db">2021.GWF-1.158</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2021.126739</doi><bibkey>Ghoreishi-etal-2021-Peering</bibkey></paper><paper id="159"><title>Sensitivity analysis: A discipline coming of age editorial for the special issue “Sensitivity analysis for environmental modelling”, Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</title><author><first>Andrea</first><last>Saltelli</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Jakeman</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>Qiongli</first><last>Wu</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a1d0554d">2021.GWF-1.159</url><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105226</doi><bibkey>Saltelli-etal-2021-Sensitivity</bibkey></paper><paper id="160"><title>A socio-hydrologic framework for understanding conflict and cooperation in transboundary rivers</title><author><first>Yongping</first><last>Wei</last></author><author><first>Jing</first><last>Wei</last></author><author><first>Gen</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Shuanglei</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>David</first><last>J.

Increasing hydrologic variability, accelerating population growth, and resurgence of water resources development projects have all indicated increasing tensions among the riparian countries of transboundary rivers. This article aims to review the existing knowledge on conflict and cooperation in transboundary rivers from a multidisciplinary perspective and propose a socio-hydrological framework that integrates the slow and less visible societal processes with existing hydrological-economic models, revealing the hidden feedbacks between changes in societal processes and hydrological changes. This framework contributes to understanding the mechanism that drives conflict and cooperation in transboundary river management.

To develop the maps, several scenarios representing the individual and compounding effects of the models’ input and parameters uncertainty were defined. Hydrologic model calibration and validation were performed using a Dynamically Dimensioned Search algorithm. A generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method was used for quantifying uncertainty. To draw on the potential benefits of the proposed methodology, a flash-flood-prone urban watershed in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, was selected. The developed floodplain maps were updated considering climate change impacts on the input uncertainty with rainfall Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) projections of RCP8.5. The results indicated that the hydrologic model input poses the most uncertainty to floodplain delineation. Incorporating climate change impacts resulted in the expansion of the potential flood area and an increase in water depth. Comparison between stationary and non-stationary IDFs showed that the flood probability is higher when a non-stationary approach is used. The large inevitable uncertainty associated with floodplain mapping and increased future flood risk under climate change imply a great need for enhanced flood modeling techniques and tools. The probabilistic floodplain maps are beneficial for implementing risk management strategies and land-use planning.</abstract><url hash="84268ebc">2021.GWF-1.161</url><doi>10.3390/W13091248</doi><bibkey>Zahmatkesh-etal-2021-Understanding</bibkey></paper><paper id="162"><title>Heterogeneous Changes to Wetlands in the Canadian Prairies Under Future Climate</title><author><first>Zhe</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bortolotti</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Armstrong</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Bell</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Numerous wetlands in the prairies of Canada provide important ecosystem services, yet are threatened by climate and land‐use changes. Understanding the impacts of climate change on prairie wetlands is critical to effective conservation planning. In this study, we construct a wetland model with surface water balance and ecoregions to project future distribution of wetlands. The climatic conditions downscaled from the Weather Research and Forecasting model were used to drive the Noah‐MP land surface model to obtain surface water balance. The climate change perturbation is derived from an ensemble of general circulation models using the pseudo global warming method, under the RCP8.5 emission scenario by the end of 21st century. The results show that climate change impacts on wetland extent are spatiotemporally heterogenous. Future wetter climate in the western Prairies will favor increased wetland abundance in both spring and summer. In the eastern Prairies, particularly in the mixed grassland and mid‐boreal upland, wetland areas will increase in spring but experience enhanced declines in summer due to strong evapotranspiration. When these effects of climate change are considered in light of historical drainage, they suggest a need for diverse conservation and restoration strategies. For the mixed grassland in the western Canadian Prairies, wetland restoration will be favorable, while the highly drained eastern Prairies will be challenged by the intensified hydrological cycle. The outcomes of this study will be useful to conservation agencies to ensure that current investments will continue to provide good conservation returns in the future.</abstract><url hash="1d2fdf06">2021.GWF-1.162</url><doi>10.1029/2020WR028727</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2021-Heterogeneous</bibkey></paper><paper id="163"><title>Stochastic bias correction for RADARSAT-2 soil moisture retrieved over vegetated areas</title><author><first>Ju</first><last>Hyoung Lee</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Budhathoki</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="6a28ef90">2021.GWF-1.163</url><doi>10.1080/10106049.2021.2017009</doi><bibkey>Hyoung Lee-etal-2021-Stochastic</bibkey></paper><paper id="164"><title>A Streamflow-oriented Ranking-based Methodological Framework to Combine Multiple Precipitation Datasets across Large River Basins</title><author><first>Jefferson</first><last>S.

Despite this, the location of production and injection wells has not been studied in detail at the regional scale and the effects on deep groundwater flow patterns (i.e., below the base of groundwater protection) possibly driving fluid flow toward shallow aquifers remain uncertain. Even where injection and production volumes are equal at the basin scale, local changes in hydraulic head can occur due to the distribution of production and injection wells. In the Canadian portion of the Williston Basin, over 4.6 × 109 m3 of water has been co‐produced with 5.4 × 108 m3 of oil, and over 5.5 × 109 m3 of water has been injected into the subsurface for salt water disposal or enhanced oil recovery. Despite approximately equal values of produced and injected fluids at the sedimentary basin scale over the history of development, cumulative fluid deficits and surpluses per unit area in excess of a few 100 mm are present at scales of a few 100 km2. Fluid fluxes associated with oil and gas activities since 1950 likely exceed background groundwater fluxes in these areas. Modeled pressures capable of creating upward hydraulic gradients are predicted for the Midale Member and Mannville Group, two of the strata with the highest amounts of injection in the study area. This could lead to upward leakage of fluids if permeable pathways, such as leaky wells, are present.</abstract><url hash="fdfa3618">2021.GWF-1.168</url><doi>10.1111/gwat.13136</doi><bibkey>Jellicoe-etal-2021-Changes</bibkey></paper><paper id="169"><title>A Model for the Soil Freezing Characteristic Curve That Represents the Dominant Role of Salt Exclusion</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Amankwah</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ireson</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Maulé</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brannen</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Mathias</last></author><abstract>The phenomenon of freezing point depression in frozen soils results in the co‐existence of ice and liquid water in soil pores at temperatures below 273.15 K (0°C), and is thought to have two causes: (a) capillary and adsorption effects, where the phase transition relationship is modified due to soil‐air‐water‐ice interactions, and (b) solute effects, where the presence of salts lowers the freezing temperature. The soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC) characterizes the relationship between liquid water content and temperature in frozen soils. Most hydrological models represent the SFC using only capillary and adsorption effects with a relationship known as the Generalized Clapeyron Equation (GCE). In this study, we develop and test a salt exclusion model for characterizing the SFC, comparing this with the GCE‐based model and a combined salt‐GCE effect model. We test these models against measured SFCs in laboratory and field experiments with diverse soil textures and salinities. We consistently found that the GCE‐based models under‐predicted freezing‐point depression. We were able to match the observations with the salt exclusion model and the combined model, suggesting that salinity is a dominant control on the SFC in real soils that always contain solutes. In modeling applications where the salinity is unknown, the soil bulk solute concentration can be treated as a single fitting parameter.

The hydraulic properties‐based calibration outperforms the texture‐based calibration in terms of reproducing changes in soil moisture storage within a 1.6 m deep profile at each site, but both perform reasonably well, especially in the summer months. When the models are constrained using observations of changes in soil moisture, the predicted hydrological fluxes are subject to very large uncertainties associated with equifinality. The uncertainty is larger for the hydraulic properties‐based calibration, even though the performance was better. We argue that since the pedotransfer functions constrain the model parameters in the texture‐based calibrations in an unrealistic way, the texture‐based calibration underestimates the uncertainty in the fluxes. We recommend that reproducing observed cumulative changes in soil moisture storage should be considered a necessary but insufficient criterion of model success. Additional sources of information are needed to reduce uncertainties, and these could include improved estimation of the soil hydraulic properties and direct observations of fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration.</abstract><url hash="ea3a8f6b">2021.GWF-1.170</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14465</doi><bibkey>Ireson-etal-2021-Using</bibkey></paper><paper id="171"><title>Radial variations in xylem sap flux in a temperate red pine plantation forest</title><author><first>Alanna</first><last>V.

Clumping index (CI) is a key canopy structural parameter, characterizing the extent to which leaf deviates from the random distribution. To assess leaf clumping effects on global terrestrial ET, we used a global leaf area index (LAI) map and the latest version of global CI product derived from MODIS BRDF data as well as the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) to estimate global terrestrial ET. The results show that global terrestrial ET in 2015 was 511.9 ± 70.1 mm yr−1 for Case I, where the true LAI and CI are used. Compared to this baseline case, (1) global terrestrial ET is overestimated by 4.7% for Case II where true LAI is used ignoring clumping; (2) global terrestrial ET is underestimated by 13.0% for Case III where effective LAI is used ignoring clumping. Among all plant functional types (PFTs), evergreen needleleaf forests were most affected by foliage clumping for ET estimation in Case II, because they are most clumped with the lowest CI. Deciduous broadleaf forests are affected by leaf clumping most in Case III because they have both high LAI and low CI compared to other PFTs. The leaf clumping effects on ET estimation in both Case II and Case III is robust to the errors in major input parameters. Thus, it is necessary to consider clumping effects in the simulation of global terrestrial ET, which has considerable implications for global water cycle research.</abstract><url hash="7333ded1">2021.GWF-1.173</url><doi>10.3390/rs13204075</doi><bibkey>Chen-etal-2021-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="174"><title>Explaining the Shortcomings of Log‐Transforming the Dependent Variable in Regression Models and Recommending a Better Alternative: Evidence From Soil CO2 Emission Studies</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Liaw</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khomik</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Arain</last></author><abstract>Log‐transforming the dependent variable of a regression model, though convenient and frequently used, is accompanied by an under‐prediction problem. We found that this underprediction can reach up to 20%, which is significant in studies that aim to estimate annual budgets. The fundamental reason for this problem is simply that the log‐function is concave, and it has nothing to do with whether the dependent variable has a log‐normal distribution or not. Using field‐observed data of soil CO2 emission, soil temperature and soil moisture in a saturated‐specification of a regression model for predicting emissions, we revealed that the under‐predictions of the log‐transformed approach were pervasive and systematically biased. The key determinant of the problem's severity was the coefficient of variation in the dependent variable that differed among different combinations of the values of the explanatory factors. By applying a parsimonious (Gaussian‐Gamma) specification of the regression model to data from four different ecosystems, we found that this under‐prediction problem was serious to various extents, and that for a relatively weak explanatory factor, the log‐transformed approach is prone to yield a physically nonsensical estimated coefficient. Finally, we showed and concluded that the problem can be avoided by switching to the nonlinear approach, which does not require the assumption of homoscedasticity for the error term in computing the standard errors of the estimated coefficients.</abstract><url hash="ed574b72">2021.GWF-1.174</url><doi>10.1029/2021JG006238</doi><bibkey>Liaw-etal-2021-Explaining</bibkey></paper><paper id="175"><title>Species and stand-age driven differences in photochemical reflectance index and light use efficiency across four temperate forests</title><author><first>Shangrong</first><last>Lin</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Coops</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Tortini</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Jia</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Nešić</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Beamesderfer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>A.

Variable retention harvesting (VRH) has been suggested to be a potential method to increase forest biodiversity, growth, and carbon (C) sequestration. A field trial was established in an 88-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation in southern Ontario, Canada, using a completely randomized design to examine the response of tree productivity and other forest values to five harvesting treatments: 33% aggregate retention (33A), 55% aggregate retention (55A), 33% dispersed retention (33D), and 55% dispersed retention (55D) in comparison to an unharvested control (CN). In this study, we explored the impacts of VRH on aboveground stem radial growth and annual C increment. Standard dendrochronological methods and allometric equations were used to quantify tree- and stand-level treatment effects during a five-year pre-harvest (2009–2013) and post-harvest (2014–2018) period. Tree-level growth and C increment were increased by the dispersed retention pattern regardless of retention level. At the stand level, the total C increment was highest at greater retention levels and did not vary with retention pattern. These results suggest that the choice of retention level and pattern can have a large influence on management objectives as they relate to timber production, climate change adaptation, and/or climate change mitigation.</abstract><url hash="6da293a4">2021.GWF-1.180</url><doi>10.3389/ffgc.2021.725890</doi><bibkey>I.

Samples were nationally balanced on age, gender, and ethnicity (total N = 6,281). We find that although risk perception varies between the time points surveyed, it is consistently, significantly, and positively correlated with the reported adoption of protective health behaviours, such as wearing face masks or social distancing. There is also an increase in reported health protective behaviours in the UK between March 2020 and January 2021. The strength of the association between risk perception and behaviour varies by time point, with a stronger relationship in January 2021 compared to March and May 2020. We also assess the stability of the psychological determinants of risk perception over time. People’s prosocial tendencies and individualistic worldviews, experience with the virus, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, as well as personal and collective efficacy all emerged as significant predictors. With few exceptions, these predictors remained consistent in their relationship with risk perception over time. Lastly, we find that psychological factors are more predictive of risk perception than an objective measure of situational severity, i.e. the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of data collection. Implications for risk communication are discussed.</abstract><url hash="83acf288">2021.GWF-1.182</url><doi>10.1080/13669877.2021.1890637</doi><bibkey>Schneider-etal-2021-COVID-19</bibkey></paper><paper id="183"><title>Monitoring, Managing, and Communicating Risk of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in Recreational Resources across Canada</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Rashidi</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Gill</last></author><author><first>Lalita</first><last>Bharadwaj</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bradford</last></author><abstract>Globally, harmful algal blooms (HABs) are on the rise, as is evidence of their toxicity. The impacts associated with blooms, however, vary across Nation states, as do the strategies and protocols to assess, monitor, and manage their occurrence. In Canada, water quality guidelines are standardized nationally, but the management strategies for HABs are not. Here, we explore current strategies to understand how to better communicate risks associated with HABs to the public. Our team conducted an environmental scan on provincial and territorial government agency protocols around HABs. Results suggest that there are variations in the monitoring, managing, and communicating of risk to the public: British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec have well-established inter-agency protocols, and most provinces report following federal guidelines for water quality. Notably, 3 northern territories have no HABs monitoring or management protocols in place. More populous provinces use a variety of information venues (websites, social media, on site postings, and radio) to communicate risks associated with HABs, whereas others’ communications are limited. To induce more collaboration on HABs monitoring and management and reduce the associated risks, creating a coherent system with consistent messaging and inter-agency communication is suggested.</abstract><url hash="f4abc21e">2021.GWF-1.183</url><doi>10.1177/11786302211014401</doi><bibkey>Rashidi-etal-2021-Monitoring,</bibkey></paper><paper id="184"><title>Simulating site-scale permafrost hydrology: Sensitivity to modelling decisions and air temperature</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Krogh</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="6acf57bd">2021.GWF-1.184</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2021.126771</doi><bibkey>Krogh-etal-2021-Simulating</bibkey></paper><paper id="185"><title>Icefield Breezes: Mesoscale Diurnal Circulation in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Over an Outlet of the Columbia Icefield, Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Conway</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Sicart</last></author><abstract>Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics over glaciers mediate the response of glacier mass balance to large‐scale climate forcing. Despite this, very few ABL observations are available over mountain glaciers in complex terrain. An intensive field campaign was conducted in June 2015 at the Athabasca Glacier outlet of Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rockies. Observations of wind and temperature profiles with novel kite and radio‐acoustic sounding systems showed a well‐defined mesoscale circulation developed between the glacier and snow‐free valley in fair weather. The typical vertical ABL structure above the glacier differed from that expected for “glacier winds”; strong daytime down‐glacier winds extended through the lowest 200 m with no up‐valley return flow aloft. This structure suggests external forcing at mesoscale scales or greater and is provisionally termed an “icefield breeze.” A wind speed maximum near the surface, characteristic of a “glacier wind,” was only observed during night‐time and one afternoon. Lapse rates of air temperature down the glacier centerline show the interaction of down‐glacier cooling driven by sensible heat loss into the ice, entrainment and periodic disruption and warming. Down‐glacier cooling was weaker in “icefield breeze” conditions, while in “glacier wind” conditions, stronger down‐glacier cooling enabled large increases in near‐surface temperature on the lower glacier during periods of surface boundary layer (SBL) disruption. These results raise several questions, including the impact of Columbia Icefield on the ABL and melt of Athabasca Glacier. Future work should use these observations as a testbed for modeling spatio‐temporal variations in the ABL and SBL within complex glaciated terrain.</abstract><url hash="1dc8672b">2021.GWF-1.185</url><doi>10.1029/2020JD034225</doi><bibkey>Conway-etal-2021-Icefield</bibkey></paper><paper id="186"><title>Analysis of growing season carbon and water fluxes of a subalpine wetland in the Canadian Rocky Mountains: Implications of shade on ecosystem water use efficiency</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Hrach</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Green</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khomik</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><abstract>Mountain regions are an important regulator in the global water cycle through their disproportionate water contribution. Often referred to as the “Water Towers of the World”, mountains contribute 40%–60% of the world's annual surface flow. Shade is a common feature in mountains, where complex terrain cycles land surfaces in and out of shadows over daily and seasonal scales, which can impact water use. This study investigated the turbulent water and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes during the snow‐free period in a subalpine wetland in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, from 7 June to 10 September 2018. Shading had a significant and substantial effect on water and CO2 fluxes at our site. When considering data from the entire study period, each hourly increase of shade per day reduced evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) by 0.42 mm and 0.77 g C m−2, equivalent to 17% and 15% per day, respectively. However, the variability in shading changed throughout the study, it was stable to start and increased towards the end. Only during the peak growing season, the site experienced days with both stable and increasing shade. During this time, we found that shade, caused by the local complex terrain, reduced ET and potentially increased GPP, likely due to enhanced diffuse radiation. The overall result was greater water use efficiency during periods of increased shading in the peak growing season. These findings suggest that shaded subalpine wetlands can store large volumes of water for late season runoff and are productive through short growing seasons.</abstract><url hash="84c13691">2021.GWF-1.186</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14425</doi><bibkey>Hrach-etal-2021-Analysis</bibkey></paper><paper id="187"><title>The Impact of Variable Horizon Shade on the Growing Season Energy Budget of a Subalpine Headwater Wetland</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Hrach</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>Brandon</first><last>Van Huizen</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Green</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Khomik</last></author><abstract>Surface energy budgets are important to the ecohydrology of complex terrain, where land surfaces cycle in and out of shadows creating distinct microclimates. Shading in such environments can help regulate downstream flow over the course of a growing season, but our knowledge on how shadows impact the energy budget and consequently ecohydrology in montane ecosystems is very limited. We investigated the influence of horizon shade on the surface energy fluxes of a subalpine headwater wetland in the Canadian Rocky Mountains during the growing season. During the study, surface insolation decreased by 60% (32% due to evolving horizon shade and 28% from seasonality). The influence of shade on the energy budget varied between two distinct periods: (1) Stable Shade, when horizon shade was constant and reduced sunlight by 2 h per day; and (2) Dynamic Shade, when shade increased and reduced sunlight by 0.18 h more each day, equivalent to a 13% reduction in incoming shortwave radiation and 16% in net radiation. Latent heat flux, the dominant energy flux at our site, varied temporally because of changes in incoming radiation, atmospheric demand, soil moisture and shade. Horizon shade controlled soil moisture at our site by prolonging snowmelt and reducing evapotranspiration in the late growing season, resulting in increased water storage capacity compared to other mountain wetlands. With the mounting risk of climate-change-driven severe spring flooding and late season droughts downstream of mountain headwaters, shaded subalpine wetlands provide important ecohydrological and mitigation services that are worthy of further study and mapping. This will help us better understand and protect mountain and prairie water resources.</abstract><url hash="f3c60607">2021.GWF-1.187</url><doi>10.3390/atmos12111473</doi><bibkey>Hrach-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="188"><title>Accelerated global glacier mass loss in the early twenty-first century.</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Hugonnet</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>McNabb</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Berthier</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Nuth</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Girod</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Farinotti</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Huss</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Dussaillant</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Brun</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Kääb</last></author><abstract /><url hash="63791b96">2021.GWF-1.188</url><doi>10.1038/s41586-021-03436-z</doi><bibkey>Hugonnet-etal-2021-Accelerated</bibkey></paper><paper id="189"><title>Subalpine forest water use behaviour and evapotranspiration during two hydrologically contrasting growing seasons in the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Langs</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Hydrological processes in mountain headwater basins are changing as climate and vegetation change. Interactions between hydrological processes and subalpine forest ecological function are important to mountain water supplies due to their control on evapotranspiration (ET). Improved understanding of the sensitivity of these interactions to seasonal and interannual changes in snowmelt and summer rainfall is needed as these interactions can impact forest growth, succession, health, and susceptibility to wildfire. To better understand this sensitivity, this research examined ET for a sub‐alpine forest in the Canadian Rockies over two contrasting growing seasons and quantified the contribution of transpiration (T) from the younger tree population to overall stand ET. The younger population was focused on to permit examination of trees that have grown under the effect of recent climate change and will contribute to treeline migration, and subalpine forest densification and succession. Research sites were located at Fortress Mountain Research Basin, Kananaskis, Alberta, where the subalpine forest examined is composed of Abies lasiocarpa (Subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce). Seasonal changes in water availability from snowmelt, precipitation, soil moisture reserves yielded stark differences in T and ET between 2016 and 2017. ET was higher in the drier year (2017), which had late snowmelt and lower summer rainfall than in the wetter year (2016) that had lower snowmelt and a rainy summer, highlighting the importance of spring snowmelt recharge of soil moisture. However, stand T of the younger trees (73% of forest population) was greater (64 mm) in 2016 (275 mm summer rainfall) than 2017 (39 mm T, 147 mm summer rainfall), and appears to be sensitive to soil moisture decreases in fall, which are largely a function of summer period rainfall. Relationships between subalpine forest water use and different growing season and antecedent (snowmelt period) hydrological conditions clarify the interactions between forest water use and alpine hydrology, which can lead to better anticipation of the hydrological response of subalpine forest‐dominated basins to climate variability and change.</abstract><url hash="147e2b00">2021.GWF-1.189</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14158</doi><bibkey>Langs-etal-2021-Subalpine</bibkey></paper><paper id="190"><title>Rapid shrub expansion in a subarctic mountain basin revealed by repeat airborne LiDAR</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Leipe</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Carey</last></author><abstract>As a consequence of increasing temperatures, a rapid increase in shrub vegetation has occurred throughout the circumpolar North and is expected to continue. Rates of shrub expansion are highly variable, both at the regional scale and within local study areas. This study uses repeat airborne LiDAR and field surveys to measure changes in shrub vegetation cover along with landscape-scale variations in a well-studied subarctic headwater catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada. Airborne LiDAR surveys were conducted in August 2007 and 2018, whereas vegetation surveys were conducted in summer 2019. Machine learning classification algorithms were used to predict shrub presence/absence in 2018 based on rasterized LiDAR metrics, with the best-performing model applied to the 2007 LiDAR to create binary shrub cover layers to compare between survey years. Results show a 63.3% total increase in detectable shrub cover &gt;= 0.45 m in height between 2007 and 2018, with an average yearly expansion of 5.8%. These changes were compared across terrain derivatives to quantify the influence of topography on shrub expansion. Terrain comparisons show that shrubs are located in and are preferentially expanding into lower and flatter areas near stream networks, at lower slope positions and with a higher potential for topographic wetness. Overall, the findings from this research reinforce the documented increase in pan-Arctic shrub vegetation in recent years, quantify the variation in shrub expansion over terrain derivatives at the landscape scale, and demonstrate the feasibility of using LiDAR to compare changes in shrub properties over time.</abstract><url hash="74b9a2e5">2021.GWF-1.190</url><doi>10.1088/2515-7620/ac0e0c</doi><bibkey>Leipe-etal-2021-Rapid</bibkey></paper><paper id="191"><title>Improvement of Snow Gauge Collection Efficiency through a Knowledge of Solid Precipitation Fall Speed</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Leroux</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><abstract>The collection efficiency of a typical precipitation gauge-shield configuration decreases with increasing wind speed, with a high scatter for a given wind speed. The high scatter in the collection efficiency for a given wind speed arises in part from the variability in the characteristics of falling snow and atmospheric turbulence. This study uses weighing gauge data collected at the Marshall Field Site near Boulder, Colorado, during the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE). Particle diameter and fall speed data from a laser disdrometer were used to show that the scatter in the collection efficiency can be reduced by considering the fall speed of solid precipitation particles. The collection efficiency was divided into two classes depending on the measured mean-event particle fall speed during precipitation events. Slower-falling particles were associated with a lower collection efficiency. A new transfer function (i.e., the relationship between collection efficiency and other meteorological variables, such as wind speed or air temperature) that includes the fall speed of the hydrometeors was developed. The root-mean-square error of the adjusted precipitation with the new transfer function with respect to a weighing gauge placed in a double fence intercomparison reference was lower than using previously developed transfer functions that only consider wind speed and air temperature. This shows that the measured fall speed of solid precipitation with a laser disdrometer accounts for a large amount of the observed scatter in weighing gauge collection efficiency.</abstract><url hash="03be9273">2021.GWF-1.191</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-20-0147.1</doi><bibkey>Leroux-etal-2021-Improvement</bibkey></paper><paper id="192"><title>Thermal Characteristics of a Beaver Dam Analogues Equipped Spring-Fed Creek in the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>T.</first><last>Munir</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are becoming an increasingly popular stream restoration technique. One ecological function BDAs might help restore is suitable habitat conditions for fish in streams where loss of beaver dams and channel incision has led to their decline. A critical physical characteristic for fish is stream temperature. We examined the thermal regime of a spring-fed Canadian Rocky Mountain stream in relation to different numbers of BDAs installed in series over three study periods (April–October; 2017–2019). While all BDA configurations significantly influenced stream and pond temperatures, single- and double-configuration BDAs incrementally increased stream temperatures. Single and double configuration BDAs warmed the downstream waters of mean maxima of 9.9, 9.3 °C by respective mean maxima of 0.9 and 1.0 °C. Higher pond and stream temperatures occurred when ponding and discharge decreased, and vice versa. In 2019, variation in stream temperature below double-configuration BDAs was lower than the single-configuration BDA. The triple-configuration BDA, in contrast, cooled the stream, although the mean maximum stream temperature was the highest below these structures. Ponding upstream of BDAs increased discharge and resulted in cooling of the stream. Rainfall events sharply and transiently reduced stream temperatures, leading to a three-way interaction between BDA configuration, rainfall and stream discharge as factors co-influencing the stream temperature regime. Our results have implications for optimal growth of regionally important and threatened bull and cutthroat trout fish species.</abstract><url hash="9ab7c3c9">2021.GWF-1.192</url><doi>10.3390/W13070990</doi><bibkey>Munir-etal-2021-Thermal</bibkey></paper><paper id="193"><title>Surface Mass-Balance Gradients From Elevation and Ice Flux Data in the Columbia Basin, Canada</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Pelto</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><abstract>The mass-balance—elevation relation for a given glacier is required for many numerical models of ice flow. Direct measurements of this relation using remotely-sensed methods are complicated by ice dynamics, so observations are currently limited to glaciers where surface mass-balance measurements are routinely made. We test the viability of using the continuity equation to estimate annual surface mass balance between flux-gates in the absence of in situ measurements, on five glaciers in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Repeat airborne laser scanning surveys of glacier surface elevation, ice penetrating radar surveys and publicly available maps of ice thickness are used to estimate changes in surface elevation and ice flux. We evaluate this approach by comparing modeled to observed mass balance. Modeled mass-balance gradients well-approximate those obtained from direct measurement of surface mass balance, with a mean difference of +6.6 ± 4%. Regressing modeled mass balance, equilibrium line altitudes are on average 15 m higher than satellite-observations of the transient snow line. Estimates of mass balance over flux bins compare less favorably than the gradients. Average mean error (+0.03 ± 0.07 m w.e.) between observed and modeled mass balance over flux bins is relatively small, yet mean absolute error (0.55 ± 0.18 m w.e.) and average modeled mass-balance uncertainty (0.57 m w.e.) are large. Mass conservation, assessed with glaciological data, is respected (when estimates are within 1σ uncertainties) for 84% of flux bins representing 86% of total glacier area. Uncertainty on ice velocity, especially for areas where surface velocity is low (&lt;10 m a−1) contributes the greatest error in estimating ice flux. We find that using modeled ice thicknesses yields comparable modeled mass-balance gradients relative to using observations of ice thickness, but we caution against over-interpreting individual flux-bin mass balances due to large mass-balance residuals. Given the performance of modeled ice thickness and the increasing availability of ice velocity and surface topography data, we suggest that similar efforts to produce mass-balance gradients using modern high-resolution datasets are feasible on larger scales.</abstract><url hash="edb0f35f">2021.GWF-1.193</url><doi>10.3389/feart.2021.675681</doi><bibkey>Pelto-etal-2021-Surface</bibkey></paper><paper id="194"><title>Hydrogeological control of the thermal regime of a sub-alpine headwater stream</title><author><first>Benjamin</first><last>Roesky</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><abstract>Stream thermal regimes are critical to the stability of freshwater
habitats. There is growing concern that climate change will result in
stream warming due to rising air temperatures, decreased shading in
forested areas due to wildfires, and changes in streamflow. Groundwater
plays an important role in controlling stream temperatures in mountain
headwaters, where it makes up a considerable portion of discharge. This
study investigated the controls on the thermal regime of a headwater
stream, and the surrounding groundwater processes, in a catchment on the
eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Groundwater discharge to
the headwater spring is partially sourced by a seasonal lake. Spring,
stream, and lake temperature, water level, discharge and chemistry data
were used to build a conceptual model of the system. Meteorological data
was used to set up a stream temperature model. A tracer test was carried
out to estimate hyporheic exchange along the study reach. This study
presents a unique example of an indirectly lake-headed stream i.e.,
where the interaction of groundwater and lake water, and the hydraulic
gradient determine the resulting stream temperature. Energy balance of
the stream is mainly controlled by radiation. Sensible and latent heat
fluxes play a secondary role, but their effects generally cancel out.
Hyporheic exchange is present but plays only a minor role in the energy
balance. During snowfall events, the latent heat associated with melting
of direct snowfall onto the water surface was responsible for rapid
stream cooling. An increase in advective inputs from groundwater and
hillslope pathways did not result in observed cooling of stream water
during rainfall events. The results from this study will assist water
resource and fisheries managers in adapting to stream temperature
changes under a warming climate.</abstract><url hash="73d466fc">2021.GWF-1.194</url><doi>10.22541/AU.162021074.43533660/V1</doi><bibkey>Roesky-etal-2021-Hydrogeological</bibkey></paper><paper id="195"><title>Beaver dams: How structure, flow state, and landscape setting regulate water storage and release.</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Rønnquist</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract /><url hash="04d3566a">2021.GWF-1.195</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147333</doi><bibkey>Rønnquist-etal-2021-Beaver</bibkey></paper><paper id="196"><title>The Role of Basin Geometry in Mountain Snowpack Responses to Climate Change</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Shea</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Snowmelt contributions to streamflow in mid-latitude mountain basins typically dominate other runoff sources on annual and seasonal timescales. Future increases in temperature and changes in precipitation will affect both snow accumulation and seasonal runoff timing and magnitude, but the underlying and fundamental roles of mountain basin geometry and hypsometry on snowmelt sensitivity have received little attention. To investigate the role of basin geometry in snowmelt sensitivity, a linear snow accumulation model and the Cold Regions Hydrological Modeling (CRHM) platform driven are used to estimate how hypsometry affects basin-wide snow volumes and snowmelt runoff. Area-elevation distributions for fifty basins in western Canada were extracted, normalized according to their elevation statistics, and classified into three clusters that represent top-heavy, middle, and bottom-heavy basins. Prescribed changes in air temperature alter both the snow accumulation gradient and the total snowmelt energy, leading to snowpack volume reductions (10–40%), earlier melt onsets (1–4 weeks) and end of melt season (3 weeks), increases in early spring melt rates and reductions in seasonal areal melt rates (up to 50%). Basin hypsometry controls the magnitude of the basin response. The most sensitive basins are bottom-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at low elevations. The least sensitive basins are top-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at high elevations. Basins with similar proportional areas at high and low elevations fall in between the others in terms of sensitivity and other metrics. This work provides context for anticipating the impacts of ongoing hydrological change due to climate change, and provides guidance for both monitoring networks and distributed modeling efforts.</abstract><url hash="9dda07d0">2021.GWF-1.196</url><doi>10.3389/frwa.2021.604275</doi><bibkey>Shea-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="197"><title>Stable isotopes of water reveal differences in plant – soil water relationships across northern environments</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Tetzlaff</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Buttle</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Carey</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kohn</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Laudon</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McNamara</last></author><author><first>Aaron</first><last>A.

These spanned a decreasing temperature gradient from Bruntland Burn (Scotland), Dorset (Canadian Shield), Dry Creek (USA), Krycklan (Sweden), to Wolf Creek (northern Canada). Xylem water was isotopically depleted compared to soil waters, most notably for deuterium. The degree to which potential soil water sources could explain the isotopic composition of xylem water was assessed quantitatively using overlapping polygons to enclose respective data sets when plotted in dual isotope space. At most sites isotopes in xylem water from angiosperms showed a strong overlap with soil water; this was not the case for gymnosperms. In most cases, xylem water composition on a given sampling day could be better explained if soil water composition was considered over longer antecedent periods spanning many months. Xylem water at most sites was usually most dissimilar to soil water in drier summer months, although sites differed in the sequence of change. Open questions remain on why a significant proportion of isotopically depleted water in plant xylem cannot be explained by soil water sources, particularly for gymnosperms. It is recommended that future research focuses on the potential for fractionation to affect water uptake at the soil‐root interface, both through effects of exchange between the vapour and liquid phases of soil water and the effects of mycorrhizal interactions. Additionally, in cold regions, evaporation and diffusion of xylem water in winter may be an important process.</abstract><url hash="eadd3746">2021.GWF-1.197</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14023</doi><bibkey>Tetzlaff-etal-2021-Stable</bibkey></paper><paper id="198"><title>Improvement of Solid Precipitation Measurements Using a Hotplate Precipitation Gauge</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Leroux</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><abstract>Accurate snowfall measurement is challenging because it depends on the precipitation gauge used, meteorological conditions, and the precipitation microphysics. Upstream of weighing gauges, the flow field is disturbed by the gauge and any shielding used usually creates an updraft, which deflects solid precipitation from falling in the gauge, resulting in significant undercatch. Wind shields are often used with weighing gauges to reduce this updraft, and transfer functions are required to adjust the snowfall measurements to consider gauge undercatch. Using these functions reduces the bias in precipitation measurement but not the root-mean-square error (RMSE). In this study, the accuracy of the Hotplate precipitation gauge was compared to standard unshielded and shielded weighing gauges collected during the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment program. The analysis performed in this study shows that the Hotplate precipitation gauge bias after wind correction is near zero and similar to wind corrected weighing gauges. The RMSE of the Hotplate precipitation gauge measurements is lower than weighing gauges (with or without an Alter shield) for wind speeds up to 5 m s−1, the wind speed limit at which sufficient data were available. This study shows that the Hotplate precipitation gauge measurement has a low bias and RMSE due to its aerodynamic shape, making its performance mostly independent of the type of solid precipitation.</abstract><url hash="7a622ad7">2021.GWF-1.198</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-20-0168.1</doi><bibkey>Thériault-etal-2021-Improvement</bibkey></paper><paper id="199"><title>Moisture budget analysis of extreme precipitation associated with different types of atmospheric rivers over western North America</title><author><first>Yaheng</first><last>Tan</last></author><author><first>Song</first><last>Yang</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Ziqian</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Qiaohong</first><last>Sun</last></author><abstract /><url hash="0d651a41">2021.GWF-1.199</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-021-05933-3</doi><bibkey>Tan-etal-2021-Moisture</bibkey></paper><paper id="200"><title>Summary and synthesis of Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) research in the interior of western Canada – Part 2: Future change in cryosphere, vegetation, and hydrology</title><author><first>C.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Barr</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>van der Kamp</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Marshall</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Campbell</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Carey</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Quinton</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ireson</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>A.

The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades.
Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate–land–hydrological
systems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrological
models. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and base
predictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions of
non-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the future
and system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefront
in the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), which
assembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise to
improve the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation and
experimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins and
other sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality and
process representation, based on this improved understanding, within the
fine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and the
large-scale Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) – Surface
and Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, applied
under past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historical
change and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second of
two articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to the
atmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.

There is high uncertainty about how the frequency of ROS events (ROS) and associated floods will change as climate warms. Previous research has found considerable spatial variability in ROS responses to climate change. Detailed global assessments have not been conducted. Here, atmospheric reanalysis data was used to drive a physically based snow hydrology model to simulate the snowpack and the streamflow response to climate warming of a 5.25 km2 virtual basin (VB) applied to different high mountain climates around the world. Results confirm that the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming is highly variable among sites, and also with different elevations, aspects and slopes in each basin. The hydrological model predicts a decrease in the frequency of ROS with warming in 30 out 40 of the VBs analyzed; the rest have increasing ROS. The dominant phase of precipitation, duration of snow cover and average temperature of each basin are the main factors that explain this variation in the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming. Within each basin, the largest decreases in ROS were predicted to be at lower elevations and on slopes with sunward aspects. Although the overall frequency of ROS drops, the hydrological importance of ROS is not expected to decline. Peak streamflows due to ROS are predicted to increase due to more rapid melting from enhanced energy inputs, and warmer snowpacks during future ROS.</abstract><url hash="d03a9763">2021.GWF-1.201</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac0dde</doi><bibkey>López‐Moreno-etal-2021-Changes</bibkey></paper><paper id="202"><title>Earlier snowmelt may lead to late season declines in plant productivity and carbon sequestration in Arctic tundra ecosystems</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Zona</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lafleur</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Hufkens</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Bailey</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Gioli</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Burba</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Goodrich</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Liljedahl</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Watts</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Farina</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Kimball</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Heimann</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Goeckede</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Pallandt</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Christensen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Mastepanov</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>López-Blanco</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Jackowicz-Korczynski</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Dolman</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Marchesini</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Commane</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Wofsy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Miller</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lipson</last></author><author><first>Josh</first><last>Hashemi</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Arndt</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Kutzbach</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Holl</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Boike</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Wille</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Sachs</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Kalhori</last></author><author><first>Xia</first><last>Song</last></author><author><first>Xiaofeng</first><last>Xu</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Humphreys</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Koven</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>Gesa</first><last>Meyer</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Gosselin</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Oechel</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4933c6d9">2021.GWF-1.202</url><doi>10.1038/s41598-022-07561-1</doi><bibkey>Zona-etal-2021-Earlier</bibkey></paper><paper id="203"><title>Special Issue “Levering Sustainable Food Systems to Address Climate Change (Pandemics and Other Shocks and Hazards): Possible Transformations”</title><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Spring</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Nelson</last></author><author><first>Irena</first><last>Knezevic</last></author><author><first>Patricia</first><last>Ballamingie</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Blay-Palmer</last></author><abstract>Since we first conceived of this Special Issue, “Levering Sustainable Food Systems to Address Climate Change—Possible Transformations”, COVID-19 has turned the world upside down [...]</abstract><url hash="3e34f64f">2021.GWF-1.203</url><doi>10.3390/su13158206</doi><bibkey>Spring-etal-2021-Special</bibkey></paper><paper id="204"><title>Learning from mistakes—Assessing the performance and uncertainty in process‐based models</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Feigl</last></author><author><first>Benjamin</first><last>Roesky</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Herrnegger</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Schulz</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><abstract>Typical applications of process‐ or physically‐based models aim to gain a better process understanding or provide the basis for a decision‐making process. To adequately represent the physical system, models should include all essential processes. However, model errors can still occur. Other than large systematic observation errors, simplified, misrepresented, inadequately parametrised or missing processes are potential sources of errors. This study presents a set of methods and a proposed workflow for analysing errors of process‐based models as a basis for relating them to process representations. The evaluated approach consists of three steps: (1) training a machine‐learning (ML) error model using the input data of the process‐based model and other available variables, (2) estimation of local explanations (i.e., contributions of each variable to an individual prediction) for each predicted model error using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) in combination with principal component analysis, (3) clustering of SHAP values of all predicted errors to derive groups with similar error generation characteristics. By analysing these groups of different error‐variable association, hypotheses on error generation and corresponding processes can be formulated. That can ultimately lead to improvements in process understanding and prediction. The approach is applied to a process‐based stream water temperature model HFLUX in a case study for modelling an alpine stream in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. By using available meteorological and hydrological variables as inputs, the applied ML model is able to predict model residuals. Clustering of SHAP values results in three distinct error groups that are mainly related to shading and vegetation‐emitted long wave radiation. Model errors are rarely random and often contain valuable information. Assessing model error associations is ultimately a way of enhancing trust in implemented processes and of providing information on potential areas of improvement to the model.</abstract><url hash="a05063ec">2021.GWF-1.204</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14515</doi><bibkey>Feigl-etal-2021-Learning</bibkey></paper><paper id="205"><title>Energy and carbon fluxes from an oil sands pit lake.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>G.

We examine changes in extreme precipitation represented by annual maxima of 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) precipitation accumulations at different spatial scales and attempt to address whether the signal in extreme precipitation has strengthened with several years of additional observations. Extreme precipitation has increased at about two-thirds of stations and the percentage of stations with significantly increasing trends is significantly larger than that can be expected by chance for the globe, continents including Asia, Europe, and North America, and regions including central North America, eastern North America, northern Central America, northern Europe, the Russian Far East, eastern central Asia, and East Asia. The percentage of stations with significantly decreasing trends is not different from that expected by chance. Fitting extreme precipitation to generalized extreme value distributions with global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate reaffirms the statistically significant connections between extreme precipitation and temperature. The global median sensitivity, percentage change in extreme precipitation per 1 K increase in GMST is 6.6% (5.1% to 8.2%; 5%–95% confidence interval) for Rx1day and is slightly smaller at 5.7% (5.0% to 8.0%) for Rx5day. The comparison of results based on observations ending in 2018 with those from data ending in 2000–09 shows a consistent median rate of increase, but a larger percentage of stations with statistically significant increasing trends, indicating an increase in the detectability of extreme precipitation intensification, likely due to the use of longer records.</abstract><url hash="4e5e02c0">2021.GWF-1.206</url><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0892.1</doi><bibkey>Sun-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="207"><title>The Mutation and Injection Framework: Evaluating Clone Detection Tools with Mutation Analysis</title><author><first>Jeffrey</first><last>Svajlenko</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>An abundant number of clone detection tools have been proposed in the literature due to the many applications and benefits of clone detection. However, there has been difficulty in the performance evaluation and comparison of these clone detectors. This is due to a lack of reliable benchmarks, and the manual efforts required to validate a large number of candidate clones. In particular, there has been a lack of a synthetic benchmark that can precisely and comprehensively measure clone-detection recall. In this paper, we present a mutation-analysis based benchmarking framework that can be used not only to evaluate the recall of clone detection tools for different types of clones but also for specific kinds of clone edits and without any manual efforts. The framework uses an editing taxonomy of clone synthesis for generating thousands of artificial clones, injects into code bases and automatically evaluates the subject clone detection tools following the mutation analysis approach. Additionally, the framework has features where custom clone pairs could also be used in the framework for evaluating the subject tools. This gives the opportunity of evaluating specialized tools for specialized contexts such as evaluating a tool’s capability for the detection of complex Type-4 clones or real world clones without writing complex mutation operators for them. We demonstrate this framework by evaluating the performance of ten modern clone detection tools across two clone granularities (function and block) and three programming languages (Java, C and C#). Furthermore, we provide a variant of the framework that can be used to evaluate specialized tools such as for large gaped clone detection. Our experiments demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of our Mutation and Injection Framework when comparing against the expected results of the corresponding tools, and widely used real-world benchmarks such as Bellon’s benchmark and BigCloneBench. We provide features so that most clone detection tools that report clones in the form of clone pairs (either in filename/line numbers or filename/tokens) could be evaluated using the framework.</abstract><url hash="39593256">2021.GWF-1.207</url><doi>10.1109/TSE.2019.2912962</doi><bibkey>Svajlenko-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="208"><title>Best management practices for mitigating agricultural nutrient pollution in the Mun River Basin, Thailand</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Bridhikitti</last></author><author><first>Thayukorn</first><last>Prabamroong</last></author><author><first>Liu</first><last>Gaohuan</last></author><author><first>Yu</first><last>Guo-an</last></author><abstract>The Mun River in NE Thailand is one of the significant tributaries of the Lower Mekong River.

This paper presents a state-of-the-art anthropogenic emission inventory developed for the European domain for a 18-year time series (2000–2017) at a 0.1° × 0.05° grid, specifically designed to support air quality modelling. The main air pollutants are included: NOx, SO2, NMVOC, NH3, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 and also CH4. To stay as close as possible to the emissions as officially reported and used in policy assessment, the inventory uses where possible the officially reported emission data by European countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution as the basis. Where deemed necessary because of errors, incompleteness of inconsistencies, these are replaced with or complemented by other emission data, most notably the estimates included in the Greenhouse gas Air pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) model. Emissions are collected at the high sectoral level, distinguishing around 250 different sector-fuel combinations, whereafter a consistent spatial distribution is applied for Europe. A specific proxy is selected for each of the sector-fuel combinations, pollutants and years. Point source emissions are largely based on reported facility level emissions, complemented by other sources of point source data for power plants. For specific sources, the resulting emission data were replaced with other datasets. Emissions from shipping (both inland and at sea) are based on the results from the a separate shipping emission model where emissions are based on actual ship movement data, and agricultural waste burning emissions are based on satellite observations. The resulting spatially distributed emissions are evaluated against earlier versions of the dataset as well as to alternative emission estimates, which reveals specific discrepancies in some cases. Along with the resulting annual emission maps, profiles for splitting PM and NMVOC into individual component are provided, as well as information on the height profile by sector and temporal disaggregation down to hourly level to support modelling activities. Annual grid maps are available in csv and NetCDF format (Kuenen et al., 2021).

Innovative technologies imply new forms of citizen participation in government. This applies to all areas even the rulemaking sphere. Modern technologies in general, and the “electronic participation” of citizens in managing the affairs of the state and regions in particular, contribute to the openness of state power, its legitimization, and the reduction of corruption. The involvement of citizens in management issues can be considered one of the factors to reduce corruption. The maturity of e-government significantly contributes to the fight against corruption. The functioning of new services is based on the principles of transparency, simplicity, wide participation of citizens in the affairs of a region / territory / country. E-government is an effective anti-corruption instrument. Services provided by the state mainly in electronic form are interconnected with anticorruption indicators and positively affect the transparency of state power and trust in the government. The same effect has platforms for communicating with citizens and identifying their opinions and problems, the presence of state bodies in social networks.

This rapid warming is expected to drive a substantial net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, particularly from the thawing of &amp;#8216;permafrost&amp;#8217;, or perennially frozen ground. However, the majority of Earth System Models do not account for permafrost or processes driving the loss of permafrost carbon. In addition, where models do consider permafrost carbon feedbacks, thaw is typically simulated as a gradual, top-down process. This ignores critical, non-linear processes - notably abrupt permafrost thaw, wildfire, and fire-induced permafrost thaw. This means that the potential for a strong positive feedback to future climate change from permafrost regions is not well understood among policy decision-makers. There is therefore an urgent need for a comprehensive and policy-relevant assessment of permafrost carbon feedbacks and their implications for the temperature goals outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement. To address this need, we built upon a reduced complexity Earth System Model and gradual permafrost thaw emulator (Gasser et. al., 2018) by incorporating abrupt thaw, fire emissions, and fire-induced thaw. Using this framework, we assessed the implications of a comprehensive representation of permafrost feedbacks for carbon budgets that constrain warming to 1.5&amp;#176;C and 2&amp;#176;C. We found that combined feedbacks - gradual thaw, abrupt thaw, and fire processes - resulted in a substantial reduction in global carbon budgets to remain below 1.5&amp;#176;C and 2&amp;#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract><url hash="c921a622">2021.GWF-1.211</url><doi>10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15535</doi><bibkey>Treharne-etal-2021-Cold</bibkey></paper><paper id="212"><title>Corrigendum: Identifying Functional Impacts of Heat-Resistant Fungi on Boreal Forest Recovery After Wildfire</title><author><first>N.</first><last>J.

Data on in situ GHG fluxes from thawing permafrost OM are scarce and OM degradability is largely unknown, causing high uncertainties in the permafrost‐carbon climate feedback. We combined in situ CO2 and methane flux measurements at an abrupt permafrost thaw feature with laboratory incubations and dynamic modeling to quantify annual CO2 release from thawing permafrost OM, estimate its in situ degradability and evaluate the explanatory power of incubation experiments. In July 2016 and 2019, CO2 fluxes ranged between 0.24 and 2.6 g CO2‐C m−2 d−1. Methane fluxes were low, which coincided with the absence of active methanogens in the Pleistocene permafrost. CO2 fluxes were lower three years after initial thaw after normalizing these fluxes to thawed carbon, indicating the depletion of labile carbon. Higher CO2 fluxes from thawing Pleistocene permafrost than from Holocene permafrost indicate OM preservation for millennia and give evidence that microbial activity in the permafrost was not substantial. Short‐term incubations overestimated in situ CO2 fluxes but underestimated methane fluxes. Two independent models simulated median annual CO2 fluxes of 160 and 184 g CO2‐C m−2 from the thaw slump, which include 25%–31% CO2 emissions during winter. Annual CO2 fluxes represent 0.8% of the carbon pool thawed in the surface soil. Our results demonstrate the potential of abrupt thaw processes to transform the tundra from carbon neutral into a substantial GHG source.</abstract><url hash="272fc70e">2021.GWF-1.213</url><doi>10.1029/2021JG006543</doi><bibkey>Knoblauch-etal-2021-Carbon</bibkey></paper><paper id="214"><title>The Potential of Bioeconomic Innovations to Contribute to a Social-Ecological Transformation: A Case Study in the Livestock System</title><author><first>Jonathan</first><last>Friedrich</last></author><author><first>Ingrid</first><last>Bunker</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Uthes</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Zscheischler</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b94b52ad">2021.GWF-1.214</url><doi>10.1007/S10806-021-09866-Z</doi><bibkey>Friedrich-etal-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="215"><title>A process-based assessment of landscape change and salmon habitat losses in the Chehalis River basin, USA</title><author><first>T.</first><last>Beechie</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Fogel</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Nicol</last></author><author><first>Britta</first><last>L.

We used three general methods of quantifying natural potential: historical maps and survey notes, contemporary reference sites, and models. Historical information was available only for the floodplain habitat analysis. We used contemporary reference sites to estimate natural potential habitat conditions for wood abundance, riparian shade, main channel length, and side channel length. For fine sediment, temperature, and beaver ponds we relied on models. We estimated a 90% loss of potential beaver pond area, 91% loss of side-channel length, and 92% loss or degradation of floodplain marshes and ponds. Spawning habitat area change due to wood loss ranged from -23% to -68% across subbasins. Other changes in habitat quantity or quality were smaller—either in magnitude or spatial extent—including rearing habitat areas, stream temperature, and accessible stream length. Historical floodplain habitat mapping provided the highest spatial resolution and certainty in locations and amounts of floodplain habitat lost or degraded, whereas use of the contemporary reference information provided less site specificity for wood abundance and side-channel length change. The models for fine sediment levels and beaver pond areas have the lowest reach-specific certainty, whereas the model of temperature change has higher certainty because it is based on a detailed riparian inventory. Despite uncertainties at the reach level, confidence in subbasin-level estimates of habitat change is moderate to high because accuracy increases as data are aggregated over multiple reaches. Our results show that the largest habitat losses were floodplain and beaver pond habitats, but use of these habitat change results in salmon life-cycle models can illustrate how the potential benefits of alternative habitat restoration actions varies among species with differing habitat preferences.</abstract><url hash="ce4c623b">2021.GWF-1.215</url><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0258251</doi><bibkey>Beechie-etal-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="216"><title>Experimental study on infiltration pattern: opportunities for sustainable management in the Northern region of India.</title><author><first>Vikram</first><last>Kumar</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Chaplot</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>J.

A comprehensive understanding of the spatial water infiltration characteristics over the soil, which is site-specific and more complex due to non-uniformity, could enhance the agriculture water use efficiency and mitigate water-related issues. The present study deals with the measurement of field infiltration characteristics using a mini disc infiltrometer in all 24 blocks of Gaya district, Bihar, which covers a wide spectrum of soil types. Results showed that the average cumulative infiltration rate (IR) for the study area varies between 0.38 and 2.20 cm/min with an average rate of 1.16 cm/min. The initial IR among all blocks was found to be high but decreased gradually with each successive reading. Moreover, the land use under forest cumulative IR was more than the cumulative IR for urban and grassland. Eight blocks (33.3%) have an IR more than the average infiltration of the area, which is good for storing the water in the aquifer and suggested constructing a recharge structure. Further investigation revealed a small IR in the inundated area, because of the maximum soil water table. The ready-to-use map showing the IR for the district was prepared, which could be used by any decision-taking during the high or low rainfall, for understanding the hydrological process, development of any reference guide for farmers for increasing the agriculture productivity and soil-water management.</abstract><url hash="57453381">2021.GWF-1.216</url><doi>10.2166/WST.2021.171</doi><bibkey>Kumar-etal-2021-Experimental</bibkey></paper><paper id="217"><title>Evaluation of statistical downscaling methods for climate change projections over Spain: Future conditions with pseudo reality (transferability experiment)</title><author><first>Alfonso</first><last>Hernanz</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>García‐Valero</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Domínguez</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Rodríguez‐Camino</last></author><abstract>The Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) is responsible for the elaboration of downscaled climate projections over Spain to feed the Second National Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC‐2) and this is the last of three papers aimed to evaluate and intercompare five empirical/statistical downscaling (ESD) methods developed at AEMET: (a) Analog, (b) Regression, (c) Artificial Neural Networks, (d) Support Vector Machines and (e) Kernel Ridge Regression, in order to decide which methods and under what configurations are more suitable for that purpose. Following the framework established by the EU COST Action VALUE, in this experiment we test the transferability of these methods to future climate conditions with the use of regional climate models (RCMs) as pseudo observations. We evaluate the marginal aspects of the distributions of daily maximum/minimum temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation, over mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands, analysed by season. For maximum/minimum temperatures all methods display certain transferability issues, being remarkable for Support Vector Machines and Kernel Ridge Regression. For precipitation all methods appear to suffer from transferability difficulties as well, although conclusions are not as clear as for temperature, probably due to the fact that precipitation does not present such a marked signal of change. This study has revealed how an analysis over a historical period is not enough to fully evaluate ESD methods, so we propose that some type of analysis of transferability should be added in a standard procedure of a complete evaluation.</abstract><url hash="20420317">2021.GWF-1.217</url><doi>10.1002/joc.7464</doi><bibkey>Hernanz-etal-2021-Evaluation</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
