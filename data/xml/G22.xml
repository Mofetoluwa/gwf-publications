However, efforts to mitigate agricultural nutrient export are challenged by the lack of coordinated monitoring programs and the unique hydrological characteristics of the prairies, notably, the dominance of snowmelt in both water flows and nutrient loads, variable runoff, variable contributing area and the issues of understanding how scale affects nutrient concentrations and prevalence of dissolved nutrient transport (over total nutrients). Efforts are being made to integrate these characteristics in process-based water quality models, but the models are often complex and are not yet ready for use by watershed managers for prioritizing implementation of beneficial management practices (BMPs). In this study, a screening and scoping approach based on nutrient export coefficient modeling was used to prioritize BMPs for the 55,700 km2 Qu’Appelle Watershed, Saskatchewan. By integrating land use information, in-stream monitoring data, stakeholder input and nutrient export coefficient modeling, the study assessed potential efficiencies of six BMPs involving fertilizer, manure, grazing, crop and wetland management in nutrient load reductions for nine tributaries of the watershed. Uncertainty around the effectiveness of the BMPs was assessed. Field-level export coefficients were adjusted with nutrient delivery ratios for estimating watershed-level exports. Of the BMPs examined, in general, wetland restoration had the greatest potential to reduce both nitrogen and phosphorus loads in most tributaries, followed by fertilizer management. The importance of wetland restoration was supported by positive, significant, linear correlations between nutrient delivery ratios and drainage intensity in the tributaries (nitrogen: R 2 = 0.67; phosphorus: R 2 = 0.82). Notably, the relative ranking of BMP efficiencies varied with tributaries, as a result of differing landscape characteristics, land uses and nutrient inputs. In conclusion, the approach developed here acknowledges uncertainty, but provides a means to guide management decisions within the context of an adaptive management approach, where BMP implementation is partnered with monitoring and assessment to revise ongoing plans and ensures selected practices are meeting goals for nutrient abatement.</abstract><url hash="412cc0de">2022.GWF-1.1</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2022.2032365</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2022-Screening</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Incentivizing the future adoption of best management practices on agricultural land to protect water resources: The role of past participation and experiences</title><author><first>Haiyan</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d8259164">2022.GWF-1.2</url><doi>10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107389</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2022-Incentivizing</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Mapping organic layer thickness and fuel load of the boreal forest in Alberta, Canada</title><author><first>Chelene</first><last>C.

To address this growing complexity, scientists from different domains require to work collaboratively. Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) are popular tools for data-intensive experiments. To the best of our knowledge, very few of the existing SWfMSs support collaboration, and it is not efficient in many cases. Researchers share a single version of the workflow in existing collaborative data analysis systems, which increases the chance of interference as the number of collaborators grows. Moreover, for effective collaboration, contributors require a clear view of the project's status, the information that existing SWfMSs do not provide. Another significant problem is most scientists are not capable of adding collaborative tools to existing SWfMSs, and they need software engineers to take on this responsibility. Even for software engineers such tasks could be challenging and time consuming. In this paper, we attempted to address this crucial issue in scientific workflow composition and doing so in a collaborative setting. Hence, we propose a tool to facilitate collaborative workflow composition. This tool provides branching and versioning, which are standard version control system features to allow multiple researchers to contribute to the project asynchronously. We also suggest some visualizations and a variety of reports to increase group awareness and help the scientists to realize the project's status and issues. As a proof of concept, we developed an API to capture the provenance data and provide collaborative tools. This API is developed as an example for software engineers to help them understand how to integrate collaborative tools into any SWfMS. We collect provenance information during workflow composition and then employ it to track workflow versions using the proposed collaborative tool. Prior to implementing the visualizations, we surveyed to discover how much the proposed visualizations could contribute to group awareness. Moreover, in the survey we investigated to what extent the proposed version control system could help address shortcomings in collaborative experiments. The survey participants provided us with valuable feedback. In future, we will use the survey responses to enhance the proposed version control system and visualizations.</abstract><url hash="df48557d">2022.GWF-1.6</url><doi>10.1145/3534520</doi><bibkey>AbediniAla-etal-2022-Facilitating</bibkey></paper><paper id="7"><title>Supporting program comprehension by generating abstract code summary tree</title><author><first>Avijit</first><last>Bhattacharjee</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Having good tool support for this code browsing activity can reduce human effort and increase overall developer productivity. To help with program comprehension activities, building an abstract code summary of a software system from its call graph is an active research area. A call graph is a visual representation of the caller-callee relationships between different methods of a software system. Call graphs can be difficult to comprehend for a large code-base. Previous work by Gharibi et al. on abstract code summarizing suggested using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) tree for understanding the codebase. Each node in the tree is associated with the top five method names. When we replicated the previous approach, we observed that the number of nodes in the AHC tree is burdensome for developers to explore. We also noticed only five method names for each node is not sufficient to comprehend an abstract node. We propose a technique to transform the AHC tree using cluster flattening for natural grouping and reduced nodes. We also generate a natural text summary for each abstract node derived from method comments. In order to evaluate our proposed approach, we collected developers’ opinions about the abstract code summary tree based on their codebase. The evaluation results confirm that our approach can not only help developers get an overview of their codebases but also could assist them in doing specific software maintenance tasks.</abstract><url hash="a84f65eb">2022.GWF-1.7</url><doi>10.1145/3510455.3512793</doi><bibkey>Bhattacharjee-etal-2022-Supporting</bibkey></paper><paper id="8"><title>Supporting Readability by Comprehending the Hierarchical Abstraction of a Software Project</title><author><first>Avijit</first><last>Bhattacharjee</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A. Schneider</last></author><abstract>Exploring the source code of a software system is a prevailing task that is frequently done by contributors to a system. Practitioners often use call graphs to aid in understanding the source code of an inadequately documented software system. Call graphs, when visualized, show caller and callee relationships between functions. A static call graph provides an overall structure of a software system and dynamic call graphs generated from dynamic execution logs can be used to trace program behaviour for a particular scenario. Unfortunately a call graph of an entire system can be very complicated and hard to understand. Hierarchically abstracting a call graph can be used to summarize an entire system’s structure and more easily comprehending function calls. In this work, we mine concepts from source code entities (functions) to generate a concept cluster tree with improved naming of cluster nodes to complement existing studies and facilitate more effective program comprehension for developers. We apply three different information retrieval techniques (TFIDF, LDA, and LSI) on function names and function name variants to label the nodes of a concept cluster tree generated by clustering execution paths. From our experiment in comparing automatic labelling with manual labeling by participants for 12 use cases, we found that among the techniques on average, TFIDF performs better with 64% matching. LDA and LSI had 37% and 23% matching respectively. In addition, using the words in function name variants performed at least 5% better in participant ratings for all three techniques on average for the use cases.</abstract><url hash="38f0787a">2022.GWF-1.8</url><doi>10.1145/3511430.3511441</doi><bibkey>Bhattacharjee-etal-2022-Supporting1</bibkey></paper><paper id="9"><title>Feature Transformation for Improved Software Bug Detection Models</title><author><first>Shamse</first><last>Tasnim Cynthia</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><abstract>Testing software is considered to be one of the most crucial phases in software development life cycle. Software bug fixing requires a significant amount of time and effort. A rich body of recent research explored ways to predict bugs in software artifacts using machine learning based techniques. For a reliable and trustworthy prediction, it is crucial to also consider the explainability aspects of such machine learning models. In this paper, we show how the feature transformation techniques can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and build confidence in building bug prediction models. We propose a novel approach for improved bug prediction that first extracts the features, then finds a weighted transformation of these features using a genetic algorithm that best separates bugs from non-bugs when plotted in a low-dimensional space, and finally, trains the machine learning model using the transformed dataset. In our experiment with real-life bug datasets, the random forest and k-nearest neighbor classifier models that leveraged feature transformation showed 4.25% improvement in recall values on an average of over 8 software systems when compared to the models built on original data.</abstract><url hash="4ff748ec">2022.GWF-1.9</url><doi>10.1145/3511430.3511444</doi><bibkey>Tasnim Cynthia-etal-2022-Feature</bibkey></paper><paper id="10"><title>Mining Software Information Sites to Recommend Cross-Language Analogical Libraries</title><author><first>Kawser</first><last>Wazed Nafi</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Asaduzzaman</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Software developers often need to find analogical libraries (libraries similar to ones they are already familiar with) as an analogical library may offer improved or additional features. Developers also need to search for analogical libraries across programming languages when developing applications in different languages or for different platforms. However, manually searching for analogical libraries is a time-consuming and difficult task. This paper presents a technique, called XLibRec, that recommends analogical libraries across different programming languages. XLibRec collects Stack Overflow question titles containing library names, library usage information from Stack Overflow posts, and library descriptions from a third party website, Libraries.io. We generate word-vectors for each information and calculate a weight-based cosine similarity score from them to recommend analogical libraries. We performed an extensive evaluation using a large number of analogical libraries across four different programming languages. Results from our evaluation show that the proposed technique can recommend cross-language analogical libraries with great accuracy. The precision for the Top-3 recommendations ranges from 62-81% and has achieved 8-45% higher precision than the state-of-the-art technique.</abstract><url hash="95f10c32">2022.GWF-1.10</url><doi>10.1109/saner53432.2022.00109</doi><bibkey>Wazed Nafi-etal-2022-Mining</bibkey></paper><paper id="11"><title>Exploring Relevant Artifacts of Release Notes: The Practitioners' Perspective</title><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana Nath</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>A software release note is one of the essential documents in the software development life cycle. The software release contains a set of information, e.g., bug fixes and security fixes. Release notes are used in different phases, e.g., requirement engineering, software testing and release management. Different types of practitioners (e.g., project managers and clients) get benefited from the release notes to understand the overview of the latest release. As a result, several studies have been done about release notes production and usage in practice. However, two significant problems (e.g., duplication and inconsistency in release notes contents) exist in producing well-written &amp; well-structured release notes and organizing appropriate information regarding different targeted users' needs. For that reason, practitioners face difficulties in writing and reading the release notes using existing tools. To mitigate these problems, we execute two different studies in our paper. First, we execute an exploratory study by analyzing 3,347 release notes of 21 GitHub repositories to understand the documented contents of the release notes. As a result, we find relevant key artifacts, e.g., issues (29%), pull-requests (32%), commits (19%), and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) issues (6%) in the release note contents. Second, we conduct a survey study with 32 professionals to understand the key information that is included in release notes regarding users' roles. For example, project managers are more interested in learning about new features than less critical bug fixes. Our study can guide future research directions to help practitioners produce the release notes with relevant content and improve the documentation quality.</abstract><url hash="e2f63ca4">2022.GWF-1.11</url><doi>10.48550/arXiv.2204.05355</doi><bibkey>Sumana Nath-etal-2022-Exploring</bibkey></paper><paper id="12"><title>Commit-Checker: A human-centric approach for adopting bug inducing commit detection using machine learning models</title><author><first>Naz</first><last>Zarreen Zarreen Oishie</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Software bug prediction is one of the promising research areas in software engineering. Software developers must allocate a reasonable amount of time and resources to test and debug the developed software extensively to improve software quality. However, it is not always possible to test software thoroughly with limited time and resources to develop high quality software. Sometimes software companies release software products in a hurry to make profit in a competitive environment. As a result the released software might have software defects and can affect the reputation of those software companies. Ideally, any software application that is already in the market should not contain bugs. If it does, depending on its severity, it might cause a great cost. Although a significant amount of work has been done to automate different parts of testing to detect bugs, fixing a bug after it is discovered is still a costly task that developers need to do. Sometimes these bug fixing changes introduce new bugs in the system. Researchers estimated that 80% of the total cost of a software system is spent on fixing bugs [8]. They show that the software faults and failures costs the US economy $59.5 billion a year [9].</abstract><url hash="7bff6d1e">2022.GWF-1.12</url><doi>10.1145/3511430.3511463</doi><bibkey>Zarreen Zarreen Oishie-etal-2022-Commit-Checker:</bibkey></paper><paper id="13"><title>Towards Automatically Generating Release Notes using Extractive Summarization Technique</title><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana Nath</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>—Release notes are admitted as an essential document by practitioners. They contain the summary of the source code changes for the software releases, such as issue ﬁxes, added new features, and performance improvements. Manually producing release notes is a time-consuming and challenging task. For that reason, sometimes developers neglect to write release notes. For example, we collect data from GitHub with over 1,900 releases, among them 37% of the release notes are empty. We propose an automatic generate release notes approach based on the commit messages and merge pull-request (PR) titles to mitigate this problem. We implement one of the popular extractive text summarization techniques, i.e., the TextRank algorithm. However, accurate keyword extraction is a vital issue in text processing. The keyword matching and topic extraction process of the TextRank algorithm ignores the semantic similarity among texts. To improve the keyword extraction method, we integrate the GloVe word embedding technique with TextRank. We develop a dataset with 1,213 release notes (after null ﬁltering) and evaluate the generated release notes through the ROUGE metric and human evaluation. We also compare the performance of our technique with another popular extractive algorithm, latent semantic analysis (LSA). Our evaluation results show that the improved TextRank method outperforms LSA.</abstract><url hash="0cf85d88">2022.GWF-1.13</url><doi>10.18293/SEKE2021-119</doi><bibkey>Sumana Nath-etal-2022-Towards</bibkey></paper><paper id="14"><title>SET-STAT-MAP: Extending Parallel Sets for Visualizing Mixed Data</title><author><first>Shisong</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Sadri</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Parallel Sets and Parallel Coordinates are two well-known techniques to visualize categorical and numerical data, respectively. A common strategy to visualize mixed data is to use multiple information linked view, e.g., Parallel Coordinates are often augmented with maps to explore spatial data with numeric attributes. In this paper, we design visualizations for mixed data, where the dataset may include numerical, categorical, and spatial attributes. The proposed solution SET-STAT-MAP is a harmonious combination of three interactive components: Parallel Sets (visualizes sets determined by the combination of categories or numeric ranges), statistics columns (visualizes numerical summaries of the sets), and a geospatial map view (visualizes the spatial information). We augment these components with colors and textures to enhance users' capability of analyzing distributions of pairs of attribute combinations. To improve scalability, we merge the sets to limit the number of possible combinations to be rendered on the display. We demonstrate the use of Set-stat-map using two different types of datasets: a meteorological dataset and an online vacation rental dataset (Airbnb). To examine the potential of the system, we collaborated with the meteorologists, which revealed both challenges and opportunities for Set-stat-map to be used for real-life visual analytics.</abstract><url hash="929cc82b">2022.GWF-1.14</url><doi>10.1109/PacificVis53943.2022.00024</doi><bibkey>Wang-etal-2022-SET-STAT-MAP:</bibkey></paper><paper id="15"><title>Using stable isotopes to track hydrological processes at an oil sands mine, Alberta, Canada</title><author><first>Spencer</first><last>J.

Quantities of viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are related to numbers of clinical cases of COVID-19 reported within the corresponding sewershed. Variants of Concern (VOCs) have been detected in wastewater by use of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or sequencing. A multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect and estimate the prevalence of multiple VOCs, including Omicron/Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, in wastewater RNA extracts was developed and validated. The probe-based multiplex assay, named N200, focuses on amino acids 199-202, a region of the N gene that contains several mutations that are associated with variants of SARS-CoV-2 within a single amplicon. Each of the probes in the N200 assay are specific to the targeted mutations and worked equally well in single- and multi-plex modes. To estimate prevalence of each VOC, the abundance of the targeted mutation was compared with a non-mutated region within the same amplified region. The N200 assay was applied to monitor frequencies of VOCs in wastewater extracts from six sewersheds in Ontario, Canada collected between December 1, 2021, and January 4, 2022. Using the N200 assay, the replacement of the Delta variant along with the introduction and rapid dominance of the Omicron variant were monitored in near real-time, as they occurred nearly simultaneously at all six locations. The N200 assay is robust and efficient for wastewater surveillance can be adopted into VOC monitoring programs or replace more laborious assays currently being used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs.</abstract><url hash="9b2a8400">2022.GWF-1.18</url><doi>10.1101/2022.04.12.22273761</doi><bibkey>Fuzzen-etal-2022-Multiplex</bibkey></paper><paper id="19"><title>Emergence and Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Alberta Communities Revealed by Wastewater Monitoring</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Hubert</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Acosta</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Waddell</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hasing</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Qiu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Fuzzen</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Harper</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>A.

Targeted assays enabled relative proportions of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants to be determined across 30 municipalities covering &gt;75% of the province of Alberta (pop. 4.5M) in Canada, from November 2021 to January 2022. Larger cities like Calgary and Edmonton exhibited a more rapid emergence of Omicron relative to smaller and more remote municipalities. Notable exceptions were Banff, a small international resort town, and Fort McMurray, a more remote northern city with a large fly-in worker population. The integrated wastewater signal revealed that the Omicron variant represented close to 100% of SARS-CoV-2 burden prior to the observed increase in newly diagnosed clinical cases throughout Alberta, which peaked two weeks later. These findings demonstrate that wastewater monitoring offers early and reliable population-level results for establishing the extent and spread of emerging pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 variants.</abstract><url hash="ec2db496">2022.GWF-1.19</url><doi>10.1101/2022.03.07.22272055</doi><bibkey>Hubert-etal-2022-Emergence</bibkey></paper><paper id="20"><title>RNA in Municipal Wastewater Reveals Magnitudes of COVID-19 Outbreaks across Four Waves Driven by SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern</title><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>K.

Here, a pipeline was developed, applied, and assessed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 and key variants of concern (VOCs) RNA in wastewater at Saskatoon, Canada. Normalization approaches using recovery ratio and extraction efficiency, wastewater parameters, or population indicators were assessed by comparing to daily numbers of new cases. Viral load was positively correlated with daily new cases reported in the sewershed. Wastewater surveillance (WS) had a lead time of approximately 7 days, which indicated surges in the number of new cases. WS revealed the variant α and δ driving the third and fourth wave, respectively. The adjustment with the recovery ratio and extraction efficiency improved the correlation between viral load and daily new cases. Normalization of viral concentration to concentrations of the artificial sweetener acesulfame K improved the trend of viral load during the Christmas and New Year holidays when populations were dynamic and variable. Acesulfame K performed better than pepper mild mottle virus, creatinine, and ammonia for population normalization. Hence, quality controls to characterize recovery ratios and extraction efficiencies and population normalization with acesulfame are promising for precise WS programs supporting decision-making in public health.</abstract><url hash="bedc5ff1">2022.GWF-1.20</url><doi>10.1021/acsestwater.1c00349</doi><bibkey>Xie-etal-2022-RNA</bibkey></paper><paper id="21"><title>Occurrence of BMAA Isomers in Bloom-Impacted Lakes and Reservoirs of Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom</title><author><first>Safa</first><last>Abbes</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>vo Duy</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Munoz</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Dinh</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Simon</last></author><author><first>Barry</first><last>R.

However, there are conflicting reports regarding their occurrence in surface waters. In this study, we evaluated the impact of amending lake water samples with trichloroacetic acid (0.1 M TCA) on the detection of BMAA isomers, compared with pre-existing protocols. A sensitive instrumental method was enlisted for the survey, with limits of detection in the range of 5–10 ng L−1. Higher detection rates and significantly greater levels (paired Wilcoxon’s signed-rank tests, p &lt; 0.001) of BMAA isomers were observed in TCA-amended samples (method B) compared to samples without TCA (method A). The overall range of B/A ratios was 0.67–8.25 for AEG (up to +725%) and 0.69–15.5 for DAB (up to +1450%), with absolute concentration increases in TCA-amended samples of up to +15,000 ng L−1 for AEG and +650 ng L−1 for DAB. We also documented the trends in the occurrence of BMAA isomers for a large breadth of field-collected lakes from Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Data gathered during this overarching campaign (overall, n = 390 within 45 lake sampling sites) indicated frequent detections of AEG and DAB isomers, with detection rates of 30% and 43% and maximum levels of 19,000 ng L−1 and 1100 ng L−1, respectively. In contrast, BAMA was found in less than 8% of the water samples, and BMAA was not found in any sample. These results support the analyses of free-living cyanobacteria, wherein BMAA was often reported at concentrations of 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than AEG and DAB. Seasonal measurements conducted at two bloom-impacted lakes indicated limited correlations of BMAA isomers with total microcystins or chlorophyll-a, which deserves further investigation.</abstract><url hash="c9db6f67">2022.GWF-1.21</url><doi>10.3390/toxins14040251</doi><bibkey>Abbes-etal-2022-Occurrence</bibkey></paper><paper id="22"><title>Improvement of field fluorometry estimates of chlorophyll a concentration in a cyanobacteria‐rich eutrophic lake</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Chegoonian</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Zolfaghari</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Leavitt</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Duguay</last></author><abstract>Instrumented buoys are used to monitor water quality, yet there remains a need to evaluate whether in vivo fluorometric measures of chlorophyll a (Chl a) produce accurate estimates of phytoplankton abundance. Here, 6 years (2014–2019) of in vitro measurements of Chl a by spectrophotometry were compared with coeval estimates from buoy‐based fluorescence measurements in eutrophic Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. Analysis revealed that fluorometric and in vitro estimates of Chl a differed both in terms of absolute concentration and patterns of relative change through time. Three models were developed to improve agreement between metrics of Chl a concentration, including two based on Chl a and phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence and one based on multiple linear regressions with measured environmental conditions. All models were examined in terms of two performance metrics; accuracy (lowest error) and reliability (% fit within confidence intervals). The model based on PC fluorescence was most accurate (error = 35%), whereas that using environmental factors was most reliable (89% within 3σ of mean). Models were also evaluated on their ability to produce spatial maps of Chl a using remotely sensed imagery. Here, newly developed models significantly improved system performance with a 30% decrease in Chl a errors and a twofold increase in the range of reconstructed Chl a values. Superiority of the PC model likely reflected high cyanobacterial abundance, as well as the excitation–emission wavelength configuration of fluorometers. Our findings suggest that a PC fluorometer, used alone or in combination with environmental measurements, performs better than a single‐excitation‐band Chl a fluorometer in estimating Chl a content in highly eutrophic waters.</abstract><url hash="50d23edd">2022.GWF-1.22</url><doi>10.1002/lom3.10480</doi><bibkey>Chegoonian-etal-2022-Improvement</bibkey></paper><paper id="23"><title>Early and late cyanobacterial bloomers in a shallow, eutrophic lake.</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Painter</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Simon</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>vo Duy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Sauvé</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><abstract>Cyanobacterial blooms present challenges for water treatment, especially in regions like the Canadian prairies where poor water quality intensifies water treatment issues. Buoyant cyanobacteria that resist sedimentation present a challenge as water treatment operators attempt to balance pre-treatment and toxic disinfection by-products. Here, we used microscopy to identify and describe the succession of cyanobacterial species in Buffalo Pound Lake, a key drinking water supply. We used indicator species analysis to identify temporal grouping structures throughout two sampling seasons from May to October 2018 and 2019. Our findings highlight two key cyanobacterial bloom phases - a mid-summer diazotrophic bloom of Dolichospermum spp. and an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom. Dolichospermum crassa and Woronichinia compacta served as indicators of the mid-summer and autumn bloom phases, respectively. Different cyanobacterial metabolites were associated with the distinct bloom phases in both years: toxic microcystins were associated with the mid-summer Dolichospermum bloom and some newly monitored cyanopeptides (anabaenopeptin A and B) with the autumn Planktothrix bloom. Despite forming a significant proportion of the autumn phytoplankton biomass (&gt;60%), the Planktothrix bloom had previously not been detected by sensor or laboratory-derived chlorophyll-a. Our results demonstrate the power of targeted taxonomic identification of key species as a tool for managers of bloom-prone systems. Moreover, we describe an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom that has the potential to disrupt water treatment due to its evasion of detection. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying this autumn bloom given the expectation that warmer temperatures and a longer ice-free season will become the norm.</abstract><url hash="27d50e4b">2022.GWF-1.23</url><doi>10.1002/essoar.10510183.1</doi><bibkey>Painter-etal-2022-Early</bibkey></paper><paper id="24"><title>Controls of lithium isotope spatial variability across the Yukon River: Implications for weathering processes in a warming subarctic basin</title><author><first>Myunghak</first><last>KangSkierszkan</last></author><author><first>Sean</first><last>R.

A research study was completed to characterize the consumption of water and beverages prepared with water and identify the perception of water consumption in Indigenous communities from the Northwest Territories and Yukon, Canada.

A focus group was conducted with Elders in an on-the-land camp setting. The consumption of water-based beverages in winter was 0.9 L/day on average, mainly consisting of tea and coffee. Of the 81% of respondents who reported consuming water-based beverages in the previous 24 hours of the survey, 33% drank more bottled water than tap water. About 2% of respondents consumed water from the land (during the winter season). Chlorine smell was the main limiting factor reported to the consumption of tap water. Results from the focus group indicated that Indigenous knowledge might impact both the perception and consumption of water. These findings aim to support public health efforts to enable people to make water their drink of choice.</abstract><url hash="57bffac4">2022.GWF-1.26</url><doi>10.1139/facets-2021-0094</doi><bibkey>Ratelle-etal-2022-Drinking</bibkey></paper><paper id="27"><title>Impacts of Wastewater Effluent Pharmaceuticals in Darter (Etheostoma Sp.)

Understanding the uncertainties associated with CNN model predictions can help to quantify errors and, therefore, guide efforts on potential enhancements using more–advanced DL models and/or synergistic approaches. This paper evaluates an approach for estimating the aleatoric uncertainty [a measure used to identify the noise inherent in data] of CNN probabilities to map ice and open water with a custom loss function applied to RADARSAT–2 HH and HV observations. The images were acquired during the 2014 ice season of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, two of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Operational image analysis charts from the Canadian Ice Service (CIS), which are based on visual interpretation of SAR imagery, are used to provide training and testing labels for the CNN model and to evaluate the accuracy of the model predictions. Bathymetry, as a variable that has an impact on the ice regime of lakes, was also incorporated during model training in supplementary experiments. Adding aleatoric loss and bathymetry information improved the accuracy of mapping water and ice. Results are evaluated quantitatively (accuracy metrics) and qualitatively (visual comparisons). Ice and open water scores were improved in some sections of the lakes by using aleatoric loss and including bathymetry. In Lake Erie, the ice score was improved by ∼2 on average in the shallow near–shore zone as a result of better mapping of dark ice (low backscatter) in the western basin. As for Lake Ontario, the open water score was improved by ∼6 on average in the deepest profundal off–shore zone.</abstract><url hash="49c90f9c">2022.GWF-1.32</url><doi>10.3390/rs14030644</doi><bibkey>Saberi-etal-2022-Incorporating</bibkey></paper><paper id="33"><title>EM-Earth: The Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for Planet Earth</title><author><first>Guoqiang</first><last>Tanga</last></author><author><first>Martyn</first><last>P.

Gridded meteorological estimates are essential for many applications. Most existing meteorological datasets are deterministic and have limitations in representing the inherent uncertainties from both the data and methodology used to create gridded products. We develop the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for Planet Earth (EM-Earth) for precipitation, mean daily temperature, daily temperature range, and dew-point temperature at 0.1° spatial resolution over global land areas from 1950 to 2019. EM-Earth provides hourly/daily deterministic estimates, and daily probabilistic estimates (25 ensemble members), to meet the diverse requirements of hydrometeorological applications. To produce EM-Earth, we first developed a station-based Serially Complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which removes the temporal discontinuities in raw station observations. Then, we optimally merged SC-Earth station data and ERA5 reanalysis estimates to generate EM-Earth deterministic estimates and their uncertainties. The EM-Earth ensemble members are produced by sampling from parametric probability distributions using spatiotemporally correlated random fields. The EM-Earth dataset is evaluated by leave-one-out validation, using independent evaluation stations, and comparing it with many widely used datasets. The results show that EM-Earth is better in Europe, North America, and Oceania than in Africa, Asia, and South America, mainly due to differences in the available stations and differences in climate conditions. Probabilistic spatial meteorological datasets are particularly valuable in regions with large meteorological uncertainties, where almost all existing deterministic datasets face great challenges in obtaining accurate estimates.</abstract><url hash="3ece3f0a">2022.GWF-1.33</url><doi>10.1175/bams-d-21-0106.1</doi><bibkey>Tanga-etal-2022-EM-Earth:</bibkey></paper><paper id="34"><title>Buffalo Pound Lake—Modelling Water Resource Management Scenarios of a Large Multi-Purpose Prairie Reservoir</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Terry</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Davies</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>Water quality models are an emerging tool in water management to understand and inform decisions related to eutrophication. This study tested flow scenario effects on the water quality of Buffalo Pound Lake—a eutrophic reservoir supplying water for approximately 25% of Saskatchewan’s population. The model CE-QUAL-W2 was applied to assess the impact of inter-basin water diversion after the impounded lake received high inflows from local runoff. Three water diversion scenarios were tested: continuous flow, immediate release after nutrient loading increased, and a timed release initiated when water levels returned to normal operating range. Each scenario was tested at three different transfer flow rates. The transfers had a dilution effect but did not affect the timing of the nutrient peaks in the upstream portion of the lake. In the lake’s downstream section, nutrients peaked at similar concentrations as the base model, but peaks arrived earlier in the season and attenuated rapidly. Results showed greater variation among scenarios in wet years compared to dry years. Dependent on the timing and quantity of water transferred, some but not all water quality parameters are predicted to improve along with the water diversion flows over the period tested. The results suggest that it is optimal to transfer water while local watershed runoff is minimal.</abstract><url hash="a0aaaaa9">2022.GWF-1.34</url><doi>10.3390/w14040584</doi><bibkey>Terry-etal-2022-Buffalo</bibkey></paper><paper id="35"><title>Climate change impacts on ice jam behavior in an inland delta: a new ice jam projection framework</title><author><first>Fan</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d7ad9a3f">2022.GWF-1.35</url><doi>10.1007/s10584-022-03312-3</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2022-Climate</bibkey></paper><paper id="36"><title>Application of L-band SAR for mapping tundra shrub biomass, leaf area index, and rainfall interception</title><author><first>Qi</first><last>Chang</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Zwieback</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>DeVries</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4ea4cb85">2022.GWF-1.36</url><doi>10.1016/j.rse.2021.112747</doi><bibkey>Chang-etal-2022-Application</bibkey></paper><paper id="37"><title>Range shifts in a foundation sedge potentially induce large Arctic ecosystem carbon losses and gains</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Curasi</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Fetcher</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hewitt</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lafleur</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Loranty</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Mack</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>May</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Myers-Smith</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Natali</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Oberbauer</last></author><author><first>Thomas</first><last>C.

As a result, future changes to their distribution may be important determinants of ecosystem carbon (C) cycling in a warmer world. We assessed the role of a foundation tussock sedge (Eriophorum vaginatum) as a climatically vulnerable C stock using field data, a machine learning ecological niche model, and an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). Field data indicated that tussock density has decreased by ∼0.97 tussocks per m2 over the past ∼38 years on Alaska’s North Slope from ∼1981 to 2019. This declining trend is concerning because tussocks are a large Arctic C stock, which enhances soil organic layer C stocks by 6.9% on average and represents 745 Tg C across our study area. By 2100, we project that changes in tussock density may decrease the tussock C stock by 41% in regions where tussocks are currently abundant (e.g. −0.8 tussocks per m2 and −85 Tg C on the North Slope) and may increase the tussock C stock by 46% in regions where tussocks are currently scarce (e.g. +0.9 tussocks per m2 and +81 Tg C on Victoria Island). These climate-induced changes to the tussock C stock were comparable to, but sometimes opposite in sign, to vegetation C stock changes predicted by an ensemble of TBMs. Our results illustrate the important role of tussocks as a foundation species in determining future Arctic C stocks and highlight the need for better representation of this species in TBMs.</abstract><url hash="39a3fb13">2022.GWF-1.37</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac6005</doi><bibkey>Curasi-etal-2022-Range</bibkey></paper><paper id="38"><title>Hydrology of peat estimated from near-surface water contents</title><author><first>Dimitre</first><last>D.

We show that near-surface θ can be a good predictor of θ at any depth and/or d WT in peat. This was achieved by further developing the formulae of an existing model and applying it for Mer Bleue bog (Ontario, Canada) and a permafrost peat plateau at Scotty Creek (Northwest Territories, Canada). Simulated θ dynamics at various depths in hummocks and hollows at both sites matched observations with R2 , Willmott’s index of agreement (d), and normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NNSE), reaching 0.97, 0.95, and 0.86, respectively. Simulated bog WT dynamics matched observations with R2 , d, and NNSE reaching 0.67, 0.87, and 0.72.

Snow accumulation determines ground temperature, light conditions and moisture availability during winter. It also affects the growing season’s start and end, and plant access to moisture and nutrients. Here, we review the current knowledge of the snow cover’s role for vegetation, plant-animal interactions, permafrost conditions, microbial processes and biogeochemical cycling. We also compare studies of natural snow gradients with snow manipulation studies, altering snow depth and duration, to assess time scale difference of these approaches. The number of studies on snow in tundra ecosystems has increased considerably in recent years, yet we still lack a comprehensive overview of how altered snow conditions will affect these ecosystems. In specific, we found a mismatch in the timing of snowmelt when comparing studies of natural snow gradients with snow manipulations. We found that snowmelt timing achieved by manipulative studies (average 7.9 days advance, 5.5 days delay) were substantially lower than those observed over spatial gradients (mean range of 56 days) or due to interannual variation (mean range of 32 days). Differences between snow study approaches need to be accounted for when projecting snow dynamics and their impact on ecosystems in future climates.</abstract><url hash="de1bd614">2022.GWF-1.39</url><doi>10.1139/as-2020-0058</doi><bibkey>Rixen-etal-2022-Winters</bibkey></paper><paper id="40"><title>Warming response of peatland CO2 sink is sensitive to seasonality in warming trends</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Zivkovic</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Alekseychik</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Aurela</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>El-Madany</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Flanagan</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Griffis</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Hanson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hattakka</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Helfter</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Hirano</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Humphreys</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Kiely</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Kolka</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Laurila</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>G.

Glass</last></author><abstract>Subsurface pipe failures in cold regions are generally believed to be exacerbated by differential strain in shallow soils induced by seasonal freeze and thaw cycles. The transient stress–strain fields resulting from soil water phase change may influence the occurrence of local buried pipe breaks including those related to urban water mains. This work proposes that freezing‐induced frost loading results in uneven stress–strain distributions along the buried water mains placing them at risk of bending, breaking, and/or leaking. A coupled thermal‐hydraulic‐mechanical (THM) model was developed to illustrate the interactions among moisture, temperature, and stress–strain fields within variably saturated freezing soils. Several typical cases involving highly frost‐susceptible and lower frost‐susceptible soils underlying roadbeds were examined. Results show that the magnitude of frost‐induced compressive stress and strain changes between different frost‐susceptible soils can vary significantly. Such substantial differences in stress–strain fields would increase the breakage risk of water mains buried within different types of soils. Furthermore, even water mains buried within soils with low frost‐susceptibility are at risk when additional sources of soil water exist and are available to migrate to the freezing front. To reduce the risk of damage to buried pipe‐like infrastructure, such as municipal water mains, from soil freezing phenomena, the selected backfill material should have fairly consistent frost susceptibility or a broad zone of transition should be considered between materials with significantly different frost susceptibility. In addition, buried pipes should be kept as far away from external sources of subsurface water as possible considering the potential for the water source to exacerbate the level of risk to the pipe.</abstract><url hash="0688995b">2022.GWF-1.42</url><doi>10.1029/2021WR030933</doi><bibkey>Huang-etal-2022-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="43"><title>A Comparative Policy Analysis of Wild Food Policies Across Ontario, Northwest Territories, and Yukon Territory, Canada</title><author><first>Connor</first><last>Judge</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Spring</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Skinner</last></author><abstract>Access to and availability of food harvested from the land (called traditional food, country food, or wild food) are critical to food security and food sovereignty of Indigenous People. These foods can be particularly difficult to access for those living in urban environments. We ask: what policies are involved in the regulation of traditional/country foods and how do these policies affect access to traditional/country food for Indigenous Peoples living in urban centers? Which policies act as barriers? This paper provides a comparative policy analysis of wild food policies across Ontario, the Northwest Territories (NWT), and the Yukon Territory, Canada, by examining and making comparisons between various pieces of legislation, such as fish and wildlife acts, hunting regulations, food premises legislation, and meat inspection regulations. We provide examples of how some programs serving Indigenous Peoples have managed to provide wild foods, using creative ways to operate within the existing system. While there is overwhelming evidence that traditional/country food plays a critical role for the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples within Canada, Indigenous food systems are often undermined by provincial and territorial wild food policies. Provinces like Ontario with more restrictive policies may be able to learn from the policies in the Territories. We found that on a system level, there are significant constraints on the accessibility of wild foods in urban spaces because the regulatory food environment is designed to manage a colonial market-based system that devalues Indigenous values of sharing and reciprocity and Indigenous food systems, particularly for traditional/country foods. Dismantling the barriers to traditional/country food access in that system can be an important way forward.</abstract><url hash="718fa9cd">2022.GWF-1.43</url><doi>10.3389/fcomm.2022.780391</doi><bibkey>Judge-etal-2022-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="44"><title>Applying Machine Learning and Time-Series Analysis on Sentinel-1A SAR/InSAR for Characterizing Arctic Tundra Hydro-Ecological Conditions</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Merchant</last></author><author><first>Mayah</first><last>Obadia</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Brisco</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>DeVries</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><abstract>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a widely used tool for Earth observation activities. It is particularly effective during times of persistent cloud cover, low light conditions, or where in situ measurements are challenging. The intensity measured by a polarimetric SAR has proven effective for characterizing Arctic tundra landscapes due to the unique backscattering signatures associated with different cover types. However, recently, there has been increased interest in exploiting novel interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques that rely on both the amplitude and absolute phase of a pair of acquisitions to produce coherence measurements, although the simultaneous use of both intensity and interferometric coherence in Arctic tundra image classification has not been widely tested. In this study, a time series of dual-polarimetric (VV, VH) Sentinel-1 SAR/InSAR data collected over one growing season, in addition to a digital elevation model (DEM), was used to characterize an Arctic tundra study site spanning a hydrologically dynamic coastal delta, open tundra, and high topographic relief from mountainous terrain. SAR intensity and coherence patterns based on repeat-pass interferometry were analyzed in terms of ecological structure (i.e., graminoid, or woody) and hydrology (i.e., wet, or dry) using machine learning methods. Six hydro-ecological cover types were delineated using time-series statistical descriptors (i.e., mean, standard deviation, etc.) as model inputs. Model evaluations indicated SAR intensity to have better predictive power than coherence, especially for wet landcover classes due to temporal decorrelation. However, accuracies improved when both intensity and coherence were used, highlighting the complementarity of these two measures. Combining time-series SAR/InSAR data with terrain derivatives resulted in the highest per-class F1 score values, ranging from 0.682 to 0.955. The developed methodology is independent of atmospheric conditions (i.e., cloud cover or sunlight) as it does not rely on optical information, and thus can be regularly updated over forthcoming seasons or annually to support ecosystem monitoring.</abstract><url hash="efeb3c6e">2022.GWF-1.44</url><doi>10.3390/rs14051123</doi><bibkey>Merchant-etal-2022-Applying</bibkey></paper><paper id="45"><title>Understanding among-lake variability of mercury concentrations in Northern Pike (Esox lucius): A whole-ecosystem study in subarctic lakes.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Moslemi-Aqdam</last></author><author><first>Leanne</first><last>F.

However, little is yet known about the source of transpiration before, during, and after snowmelt when trees rehydrate and recommence transpiration in the spring. This study investigates tree water use during spring snowmelt following tree's winter stem shrinkage. We document the source of transpiration of three boreal forest tree species—Pinus banksiana, Picea mariana, and Larix laricina—by combining observations of weekly isotopic signatures (δ18O and δ2H) of xylem, soil water, rainfall and snowmelt with measurements of soil moisture dynamics, snow depth and high‐resolution temporal measurements of stem radius changes and sap flow. Our data shows that the onset of stem rehydration and transpiration overlaps with snowmelt for evergreens. During rehydration and transpiration onset, xylem water at the canopy reflected a constant pre‐melt isotopic signature likely showing late fall conditions. As snowmelt infiltrates the soil and recharges the soil matrix, soil water shows a rapid isotopic shift to depleted‐snowmelt water values. While there was an overlap between snowmelt and transpiration timing, xylem and soil water isotopic values did not overlap during transpiration onset. Our data showed 1–2‐week delay in the shift in xylem water from pre‐melt to clear snowmelt‐depleted water signatures in evergreen species. This delay appears to be controlled by tree water transit time that was in the order of 9–18 days. Our study shows that snowmelt is a key source for stem rehydration and transpiration in the boreal forest during spring onset.</abstract><url hash="76e26dd4">2022.GWF-1.47</url><doi>10.1029/2022WR032344</doi><bibkey>Nehemy-etal-2022-Snowmelt</bibkey></paper><paper id="48"><title>Dietary Intakes of Traditional Foods for Dene/Métis in the Dehcho and Sahtú Regions of the Northwest Territories</title><author><first>M.</first><last>R.

The main aim of the present study is to describe dietary intakes for macronutrients and micronutrients in traditional and market food from the Mackenzie Valley study. We also show the trends of contributions and differences of dietary intakes over time from 1994 data collected and reported by the Centre for Indigenous People’s Nutrition and Environment (CINE) in 1996. Based on 24-h dietary recall data, the study uses descriptive statistics to describe the observed dietary intake of the Dene First Nations communities in the Dehcho and Sahtú regions of the NWT. Indigenous people in Canada, like the sub-Arctic regions of Dehcho and Sahtú of the NWT, continue to consume traditional foods, although as a small percentage of their total dietary intake. The observed dietary intake calls for action to ensure that traditional food remains a staple as it is critical for the wellbeing of Dene in the Dehcho and Sahtú regions and across the territory.</abstract><url hash="e65d7045">2022.GWF-1.48</url><doi>10.3390/nu14020378</doi><bibkey>R.

Because many of those applications require conductive materials, we recently developed a method for preparing a conductive form of MoS2 (c-MoS2) using dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide in a simple and safe way. Here, we investigate modulating the chemical and mechanical surface properties of c-MoS2 thin films using diazonium chemistry. In addition to a direct passivation strategy of c-MoS2 with diazonium salts for electron-withdrawing groups, we also propose a novel in situ synthetic pathway for modification with electron-donating groups. The obtained results are examined by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The degree of surface passivation of pristine and functionalized c-MoS2 films was tested by exposing them to aqueous solutions of different metal cations (Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+) and detecting the chemiresistive response. While pristine films were found to interact with several of the cations, modified films did not. We propose that a surface charge transfer mechanism is responsible for the chemiresistive response of the pristine films, while both modification routes succeeded at complete surface passivation. Functionalization was also found to lower the coefficient of friction for semiconducting 2H-MoS2, while all conductive materials (modified or not) also had lower coefficients of friction. This opens up a pathway to a palette of dry lubricant materials with improved chemical stability and tunable conductivity. Thus, both in situ and direct diazonium chemistries are powerful tools for tuning chemical and mechanical properties of conductive MoS2 for new devices and lubricants based on conductive MoS2.</abstract><url hash="81f73db9">2022.GWF-1.55</url><doi>10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c03061</doi><bibkey>Saha-etal-2022-Tuning</bibkey></paper><paper id="56"><title>Colorimetric Detection of Heavy Metal Ions Using Superabsorptive Hydrogels and Evaporative Concentration for Water Quality Monitoring</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Fathalla</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="18fe6c03">2022.GWF-1.56</url><doi>10.1021/acsestwater.2c00070</doi><bibkey>Fathalla-etal-2022-Colorimetric</bibkey></paper><paper id="57"><title>Selection of Aptamers for Sensing Caffeine and Discrimination of Its Three Single Demethylated Analogues.</title><author><first>P.</first><last>J.

 Monitoring the real-time status of food products using pH sensors is important to determine if pathogens are present and growing, which in turn affects food quality. A promising material for pH sensors is ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) due to its chemical stability and excellent performance. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO) provides an electrode with large surface area and good electrical properties. Here, in situ sol-gel deposition of RuO2 nanoparticles on the surface of GO as a facile, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly approach is used for the fabrication of a flexible pH sensor. As-synthesized GO-RuO2 nanocomposites with a low volume were applied on the surface of screen printed carbon paste. The obtained GO-RuO2 nanocomposite pH sensor achieved high pH sensitivity (55.5 mV/pH) in the pH range of 4-10, up to 4 times higher compared to the unmodified carbon electrode. The increased sensitivity is due to the positive role of RuO2 nanoparticles densely anchored across the GO sheets. It also shows low drift (0.36 mV/hr) and low hysteretic width. Considering this novel method and material with the cost-effective green synthesis approach, as well as excellent pH sensing properties, GO-RuO2 can be considered as a promising material for production of high-performance electrochemical pH sensors.</abstract><url hash="ff464104">2022.GWF-1.58</url><doi>10.1149/1945-7111/ac5f1f</doi><bibkey>Taheri-etal-2022-Green</bibkey></paper><paper id="59"><title>Reagent-Free Hydrogen Peroxide Sensing Using Carbon Nanotube Chemiresistors with Electropolymerized Crystal Violet</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Patel</last></author><author><first>Dipankar</first><last>Saha</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kruse</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="88417192">2022.GWF-1.59</url><doi>10.1021/acsanm.1c04540</doi><bibkey>Patel-etal-2022-Reagent-Free</bibkey></paper><paper id="60"><title>Evaluation of baseflow separation methods with real and synthetic streamflow data from a watershed</title><author><first>Siyu</first><last>Cheng</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Tong</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Illman</last></author><abstract /><url hash="dab09af5">2022.GWF-1.60</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128279</doi><bibkey>Cheng-etal-2022-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="61"><title>Investigation of the effect of sucrose substitution with Stevia on the structure, physicochemical and sensory properties of ice cream</title><author><first>Khanda</first><last>Sirwan Satar-AlDavdi</last></author><abstract>  
Abstract: 
Consumption of milk and its products is considered as one of the indicators of human societies' development. Ice cream as one of the most popular milk products around the world has many fans but due to its high amount of sucrose has negative effects on health. Stevia, a natural sweetener, was used as a sucrose substitute at 0-100% replacement levels in ice cream formulation. To investigate the treatments produced, physicochemical properties in ice cream including specific gravity, viscosity, melting time of the first drop, melting amount, overrun. The results showed that viscosity decreased by 100% by increasing the amount of stevia replacement. While overrun, Firmness, melting time of the first drop and consequently the melting stability of the samples increased with increasing the percentage of stevia used, Sensory test results showed that there was no significant difference between stevia and control samples except cold sensation and ice crystal. As a general result, stevia sweetener is a suitable substitute for sugar and samples containing 100-75% stevia were identified as desirable treatment.</abstract><url hash="adb7aa63">2022.GWF-1.61</url><doi>10.32410/huj-10417</doi><bibkey>Sirwan Satar-AlDavdi-etal-2022-Investigation</bibkey></paper><paper id="62"><title>Crosstalk analysis and optimization in a compact microwave-microfluidic device towards simultaneous sensing and heating of individual droplets</title><author><first>Weijia</first><last>Cui</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Abbasi</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Ren</last></author><abstract>Non-invasive contactless simultaneous sensing and heating of individual droplets would allow droplet microfluidics to empower a wide range of applications. However, it is challenging to realize simultaneous sensing and heating of individual droplets as the resonance frequency of the droplet fluid, which is decided by its permittivity, must be known so that energy is only supplied at this frequency for droplet heating with one resonator. To tailor the energy transfer in real-life heating applications, the droplet has to be sensed first to identify its corresponding resonance frequency, which is used to dynamically tune the frequency for supplying the required energy for heating this particular droplet. To achieve this goal, two resonators are needed, with one for sensing and one for heating. Integrating multiple resonators into one typical microfluidic device limits placement of the resonators to be as close as possible, which would raise the concern of crosstalk between them. The crosstalk would result in inaccurate sensing and heating. This study focuses on numerically and experimentally investigating the effect of influencing parameters on the crosstalk between two adjacent resonators with the ultimate goal of providing guidance for multiplexing the resonators in a typical microfluidic device. ANSYS HFSS is used to perform the electromagnetic analysis based on the finite element method. Experimental studies are conducted on a microfluidic chip integrated with two resonators to validate the numerical results. An optimal distance between two resonators is suggested, with the recommendation for the resonator size and heating power towards simultaneous sensing and heating of individual droplets.</abstract><url hash="34befbd9">2022.GWF-1.62</url><doi>10.1088/1361-6439/ac821e</doi><bibkey>Cui-etal-2022-Crosstalk</bibkey></paper><paper id="63"><title>Meteorological and hydrological data from the Alder Creek watershed, SW Ontario</title><author><first>Andrew</first><last>J.

publicly available, but may be representative of diverse types of
hydrological contexts when assessing patterns. These types of data may also
prove valuable for informing numerical experimentation and practical
modelling. This paper presents data collected in the Alder Creek watershed,
located within the Grand River basin in Ontario, Canada. The Alder Creek
watershed provides source water from the aquifers of the Waterloo Moraine
for multiple well fields that supply the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo.
Recharge rates and human impacts on streamflow are important topics for the
watershed, and many numerical models of the area have been constructed. In
order to support these types of analyses, field equipment was deployed
within the watershed between 2013 and 2018 to monitor groundwater levels,
stream stage, soil moisture, soil temperature, rainfall, and other weather
parameters. The available data are described, complementary information is
presented, and examples of possible analyses are cited and illustrated. The

These blooms can be detected using optical radiometers due to the presence of phycocyanin (PC) pigments. The spectral resolution of best-available multispectral sensors limits their ability to diagnostically detect PC in the presence of other photosynthetic pigments. To assess the role of spectral resolution in the determination of PC, a large (&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$N =905$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;) database of colocated &lt;italic&gt;in situ&lt;/italic&gt; radiometric spectra and PC are employed.

Climate change is expected to change the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) and extreme temperature events (i.e, altered timing, extreme heat/cold events) in temperate cold regions, which may hasten microbial consumption of fall-amended fertilizers, decreasing potency come the growing season. We conducted a high-resolution temporal examination of the impacts of freeze-thaw and nutrient stress on microbial communities in agricultural soils across both soil depth and time. Four soil columns were incubated under a climate model of a non-growing season including precipitation, temperature, and thermal gradient with depth over 60 days. Two columns were amended with fertilizer, and two incubated as unamended soil. The impacts of repeated FTC and nutrient stress on bacterial, archaeal, and fungal soil community members were determined, providing a deeply sampled longitudinal view of soil microbial response to non-growing season conditions. Geochemical changes from flow-through leachate and amplicon sequencing of 16S and ITS rRNA genes were used to assess community response. Despite nitrification observed in fertilized columns, there were no significant microbial diversity, core community, or nitrogen cycling population trends in response to nutrient stress. FTC impacts were observable as an increase in alpha diversity during FTC. Community compositions shifted across a longer time frame than individual FTC, with bulk changes to the community in each phase of the experiment. Our results demonstrate microbial community composition remains relatively stable for archaea, bacteria, and fungi through a non-growing season, independent of nutrient availability. This observation contrasts canonical thinking that FTC have significant and prolonged effects on microbial communities. In contrast to permafrost and other soils experiencing rare FTC, in temperate agricultural soils regularly experiencing such perturbations, the response to freeze-thaw and fertilizer stress may be muted by a more resilient community or be controlled at the level of gene expression rather than population turn-over. These results clarify the impacts of winter FTC on fertilizer consumption, with implications for agricultural best practices and modeling of biogeochemical cycling in agroecosystems.</abstract><url hash="33d33fc0">2022.GWF-1.66</url><doi>10.3389/fenvs.2022.908568</doi><bibkey>Jensen-etal-2022-Microbial</bibkey></paper><paper id="67"><title>The effects of roadways on lakes and ponds: a systematic review and assessment of knowledge gaps</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Dixon</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elmarsafy</last></author><author><first>Natasha</first><last>Hannan</last></author><author><first>Vivian</first><last>Gao</last></author><author><first>Caitlin</first><last>Wright</last></author><author><first>Layana</first><last>Khan</last></author><author><first>Derek</first><last>K.

Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: 1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and 2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970-2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers respectively), habitat fragmentation, (37 papers) and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%) and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways. However, we speculate that rectifying the geographic and taxonomic bias of our current knowledge could significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of roads on lentic environments, thereby better informing environmental management of these important habitats.</abstract><url hash="44d40f56">2022.GWF-1.67</url><doi>10.1139/er-2022-0022</doi><bibkey>Dixon-etal-2022-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="68"><title>Freezing Rain Events that Impacted the Province of New Brunswick, Canada, and Their Evolution in a Warmer Climate</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Chartrand</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>Sébastien</first><last>Marinier</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d46b12c7">2022.GWF-1.68</url><doi>10.1080/07055900.2022.2092444</doi><bibkey>Chartrand-etal-2022-Freezing</bibkey></paper><paper id="69"><title>Human Influence on the 2021 British Columbia Floods</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Gillett</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Cannon</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Malinina</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Schnorbus</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Anslow</last></author><author><first>Qiaohong</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kirchmeier‐Young</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Seiler</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Flato</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wan</last></author><author><first>Guilong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Armel</first><last>Castellan</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a36c2251">2022.GWF-1.69</url><doi>10.2139/ssrn.4025205</doi><bibkey>Gillett-etal-2022-Human</bibkey></paper><paper id="70"><title>The Severe Multi-Day October 2019 Snow Storm Over Southern Manitoba, Canada</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Hanesiak</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><author><first>Dylan</first><last>Painchaud-Niemi</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Milrad</last></author><author><first>George</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Vieira</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>Mélissa</first><last>Cholette</last></author><author><first>Kyle</first><last>Ziolkowski</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT A devastating storm struck southern Manitoba, Canada on 10–13 October 2019, producing a large region of mainly sticky and wet snow. Accumulations reached 75 cm, wind gusts exceeded 100 km h−1, and surface temperature (T) remained near 0°C (−1°C ≤ T ≤ 1°C) for up to 88 h. It produced the largest October snowfall and was the earliest to produce at least 20 cm since 1872 in Winnipeg. These factors led to unparalleled damage and power restoration challenges for Manitoba Hydro and, with leaves still largely on vegetation, the most damaging storm to Winnipeg’s trees ever recorded. The storm’s track was uncommon, and produced elevated convection related to buoyancy-driven instability and conditional symmetric instability (CSI), with a moist absolutely unstable layer (MAUL) near 500 hPa. Instabilities were released via lift through lower-tropospheric warm advection and frontogenesis, differential cyclonic vorticity advection, and jet streak dynamics. Precipitation bands, elevated convection, and lake effect snow bands enhanced local snowfall. Snow adhering to structures was not always wet but, when present, it sometimes occurred because of incomplete freezing of particles partially melted aloft in a near-surface (&lt;100 m deep) inversion.

Winter precipitation is the source of many inconveniences in many regions of North America, for both infrastructure and the economy. The ice storm that hit the Canadian Maritime provinces on 24–26 January 2017 remains one of the most expensive in history for the province of New Brunswick. Up to 50 mm of freezing rain caused power outages across the province, depriving up to one-third of New Brunswick residences of electricity, with some outages lasting two weeks. This study aims to investigate the meteorological conditions during this severe storm and their contribution to major power outages using high-resolution atmospheric modelling. The persistence of a deep warm layer aloft, coupled with the slow movement of the associated low-pressure system, contributed to widespread ice accumulation. When combined with the strong winds observed, extensive damage to electricity networks was inevitable. A 2-m temperature cold bias was identified between the simulation and the observations, in particular during periods of freezing rain. In the northern part of New Brunswick, cold air advection helped keep temperatures below 0°C, while in southern regions, the 2-m temperature increased rapidly to slightly above 0°C due to radiational heating. The knowledge gained in this study on the processes associated with either maintaining or stopping freezing rain will enhance the ability to forecast and, in turn, to mitigate the hazards associated with those extreme events.</abstract><url hash="b4ac9b22">2022.GWF-1.71</url><doi>10.1175/jamc-d-21-0217.1</doi><bibkey>Thériault-etal-2022-Meteorological</bibkey></paper><paper id="72"><title>Cooling Effects Revealed by Modeling of Wetlands and Land‐Atmosphere Interactions</title><author><first>Z.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Barlage</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bortolotti</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Ma</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Wetlands are important ecosystems—they provide vital hydrological and ecological services such as regulating floods, storing carbon, and providing wildlife habitat. The ability to simulate their spatial extents and hydrological processes is important for valuing wetlands' function. The purpose of this study is to dynamically represent the spatial extents and hydrological processes of wetlands and investigate their feedback to regional climate in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America, where a large number of wetlands exist. In this study, we incorporated a wetland scheme into the Noah‐MP land surface model with two major modifications: (a) modifying the subgrid saturation fraction for spatial wetland extent and (b) incorporating a dynamic wetland storage to simulate hydrological processes. This scheme was evaluated at a fen site in central Saskatchewan, Canada and applied regionally in the PPR with 13‐year climate forcing produced by a high‐resolution convection‐permitting model. The differences between wetland and no‐wetland simulations are significant, with increasing latent heat and evapotranspiration while suppressing sensible heat and runoff in the wetland scheme. Finally, the dynamic wetland scheme was applied in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The wetlands scheme not only modifies the surface energy balance but also interacts with the lower atmosphere, shallowing the planetary boundary layer height and promoting cloud formation. A cooling effect of 1–3°C in summer temperature is evident where wetlands are abundant. In particular, the wetland simulation shows reduction in the number of hot days for &gt;10 days over the summer of 2006, when a long‐lasting heatwave occurred. This research has great implications for land surface/regional climate modeling and wetland conservation, especially in mitigating extreme heatwaves under climate change.</abstract><url hash="2da5ca98">2022.GWF-1.72</url><doi>10.1029/2021WR030573</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2022-Cooling</bibkey></paper><paper id="73"><title>Challenges in hydrologic-land surface modelling of permafrost signatures - Impacts of parameterization on model fidelity under the uncertainty of forcing</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Abdelhamed</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract /><url hash="5aa2fa0e">2022.GWF-1.73</url><doi>10.1002/essoar.10510317.1</doi><bibkey>Abdelhamed-etal-2022-Challenges</bibkey></paper><paper id="74"><title>Hydrologic‐land surface modelling of the Canadian sporadic‐discontinuous permafrost: Initialization and uncertainty propagation</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Abdelhamed</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract>Permafrost thaw has been observed in recent decades in the Northern Hemisphere and is expected to accelerate with continued global warming. Predicting the future of permafrost requires proper representation of the interrelated surface/subsurface thermal and hydrologic regimes. Land surface models (LSMs) are well suited for such predictions, as they couple heat and water interactions across soil‐vegetation‐atmosphere interfaces and can be applied over large scales. LSMs, however, are challenged by the long‐term thermal and hydraulic memories of permafrost and the paucity of historical records to represent permafrost dynamics under transient climate conditions. In this study, we aim to understand better how LSMs function under different spin‐up states, which facilitates addressing the challenge of model initialization by characterizing the impact of initial climate conditions and initial soil frozen and liquid water contents on the simulation length required to reach equilibrium. Further, we quantify how the uncertainty in model initialization propagates to simulated permafrost dynamics. Modelling experiments are conducted with the Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire—Surface and Hydrology (MESH) framework and its embedded Canadian land surface scheme (CLASS). The study area is in the Liard River basin in the Northwest Territories of Canada with sporadic and discontinuous regions. Results show that uncertainty in model initialization controls various attributes of simulated permafrost, especially the active layer thickness, which could change by 0.5–1.5 m depending on the initial condition chosen. The least number of spin‐up cycles is achieved with near field capacity condition, but the number of cycles varies depending on the spin‐up year climate. We advise an extended spin‐up of 200–1000 cycles to ensure proper model initialization under different climatic conditions and initial soil moisture contents.</abstract><url hash="c4c66fad">2022.GWF-1.74</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14509</doi><bibkey>Abdelhamed-etal-2022-Hydrologic‐land</bibkey></paper><paper id="75"><title>Comparing the applicability of hydro-economic modelling approaches for large-scale decision-making in multi-sectoral and multi-regional river basins</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Eamen</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b3c15f3b">2022.GWF-1.75</url><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105385</doi><bibkey>Eamen-etal-2022-Comparing</bibkey></paper><paper id="76"><title>River rhythmicity: A conceptual means of understanding and leveraging the relational values of rivers</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Jackson</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Anderson</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Piland</last></author><author><first>Solomon</first><last>Carriere</last></author><author><first>Lilia</first><last>Java</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Jardine</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2ac80e81">2022.GWF-1.76</url><doi>10.1002/pan3.10335</doi><bibkey>Jackson-etal-2022-River</bibkey></paper><paper id="77"><title>Climate change impact on water supply and hydropower generation potential in Northern Manitoba</title><author><first>S.</first><last>J.

Unfortunately, the commonly used split‐sample test (SST) framework for data splitting requires modelers to make subjective decisions without clear guidelines. This large‐sample SST assessment study empirically assesses how different data splitting methods influence post‐validation model testing period performance, thereby identifying optimal data splitting methods under different conditions. This study investigates the performance of two lumped conceptual hydrological models calibrated and tested in 463 catchments across the United States using 50 different data splitting schemes. These schemes are established regarding the data availability, length and data recentness of continuous calibration sub‐periods (CSPs). A full‐period CSP is also included in the experiment, which skips model validation. The assessment approach is novel in multiple ways including how model building decisions are framed as a decision tree problem and viewing the model building process as a formal testing period classification problem, aiming to accurately predict model success/failure in the testing period. Results span different climate and catchment conditions across a 35‐year period with available data, making conclusions quite generalizable. Calibrating to older data and then validating models on newer data produces inferior model testing period performance in every single analysis conducted and should be avoided. Calibrating to the full available data and skipping model validation entirely is the most robust split‐sample decision. Experimental findings remain consistent no matter how model building factors (i.e., catchments, model types, data availability, and testing periods) are varied. Results strongly support revising the traditional split‐sample approach in hydrological modeling.</abstract><url hash="cd702386">2022.GWF-1.78</url><doi>10.1029/2021WR031523</doi><bibkey>Shen-etal-2022-Time</bibkey></paper><paper id="79"><title>Estimating the Total Economic Costs of Nutrient Emission Reduction Policies to Halt Eutrophication in the Great Lakes</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Garcia-Hernandez</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>Rute</first><last>Pinto</last></author><abstract>The Great Lakes (GL) in North America are among the largest freshwater resources on the planet facing serious eutrophication problems as a result of excessive nutrient loadings due to population and economic growth. More than a third of Canada's GDP is generated in and around the GL. Hence, the economic interests affected by pollution and pollution control are high. New policies to reduce pollution are often insufficiently informed due to the lack of integrated models and methods that provide decision‐makers insight into the direct and indirect economic impacts of their policies. This study fills this knowledge gap and estimates the impacts of different total phosphorus (TP) restriction policy scenarios across the GL. A first of its kind multi‐regional hydro‐economic model is built for the Canadian GL, extended to include TP emissions from point and non‐point sources. This optimization model is furthermore extended with a pollution abatement cost function that allows sectors to also take technical measures to meet the imposed pollution reduction targets. The latter is a promising new avenue for extending existing hydro‐economic input‐output modeling frameworks. The results show decision‐makers the least cost‐way to achieve different TP emission reduction targets. The estimated cost to reduce TP emissions by 40% in all GL amounts to a total annual cost of 3 billion Canadian dollars or 0.15% of Canada's GDP. The cost structure changes substantially as policy targets become more stringent, increasing the share of indirect costs and affecting not only the economic activities around the GL, but the economy of Canada as a whole due to the tightly interwoven economic structure.</abstract><url hash="ba771310">2022.GWF-1.79</url><doi>10.1029/2021WR030772</doi><bibkey>Garcia-Hernandez-etal-2022-Estimating</bibkey></paper><paper id="80"><title>Advances in modelling large river basins in cold regions with Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire—Surface and Hydrology (MESH), the Canadian hydrological land surface scheme</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Pietroniro</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Davison</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>Fuad</first><last>Yassin</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>Abbas</first><last>Fayad</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Tesemma</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Princz</last></author><author><first>Y.</first><last>Loukili</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ireson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Elshorbagy</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>MacDonald</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Abdelhamed</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Haghnegahdar</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Bahrami</last></author><abstract>Cold regions provide water resources for half the global population yet face rapid change. Their hydrology is dominated by snow, ice and frozen soils, and climate warming is having profound effects. Hydrological models have a key role in predicting changing water resources but are challenged in cold regions. Ground‐based data to quantify meteorological forcing and constrain model parameterization are limited, while hydrological processes are complex, often controlled by phase change energetics. River flows are impacted by poorly quantified human activities. This paper discusses the scientific and technical challenges of the large‐scale modelling of cold region systems and reports recent modelling developments, focussing on MESH, the Canadian community hydrological land surface scheme. New cold region process representations include improved blowing snow transport and sublimation, lateral land‐surface flow, prairie pothole pond storage dynamics, frozen ground infiltration and thermodynamics, and improved glacier modelling. New algorithms to represent water management include multistage reservoir operation. Parameterization has been supported by field observations and remotely sensed data; new methods for parameter identification have been used to evaluate model uncertainty and support regionalization. Additionally, MESH has been linked to broader decision‐support frameworks, including river ice simulation and hydrological forecasting. The paper also reports various applications to the Saskatchewan and Mackenzie River basins in western Canada (0.4 and 1.8 million km2). These basins arise in glaciated mountain headwaters, are partly underlain by permafrost, and include remote and incompletely understood forested, wetland, agricultural and tundra ecoregions. These illustrate the current capabilities and limitations of cold region modelling, and the extraordinary challenges to prediction, including the need to overcoming biases in forcing data sets, which can have disproportionate effects on the simulated hydrology.</abstract><url hash="4433b77b">2022.GWF-1.80</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14557</doi><bibkey>Wheater-etal-2022-Advances</bibkey></paper><paper id="81"><title>Managing nitrogen legacies to accelerate water quality improvement</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Basu</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>V.

 To date, Indigenous youth in Canada face significant socio-political risks and threats to their mental wellness, such as intergenerational trauma, water insecurity, environmental degradation, and lack of safe housing. Given the need for mental wellness resources for Indigenous youth, there has been a rising interest in technology-based interventions and mobile applications. The JoyPopTM app is a mobile mental health tool, shown to reduce depression and increase emotions management. We conducted 19 consultations (32% male) about the JoyPopTM app with key adult community stakeholders from the Six Nations of the Grand River Community, with the aim of gathering feedback (e.g., general thoughts and suggestions for improvement) about the app as a resilience tool for Indigenous youth. Consultations were coded in a double-blind fashion and analyzed for emerging themes. Overall, the majority of consultants (&gt;50%) spontaneously offered positive feedback about the app, with significant enthusiasm for the social connecting elements (e.g., the Circle of Trust feature). Also, importance was given to the need to incorporate traditional colours and design elements (e.g., beadwork, nature backgrounds, etc.), as well as cultural practices (e.g., inclusion of new features/activities related to nature, adding Indigenous sounds to the SleepEase activity, etc.). Suggested changes and improvements will be taken into consideration for future adaptations to the JoyPopTM app, to develop a more culturally relevant app that better supports Indigenous youth mental wellness.

We hypothesized that increased insecticide applications (proportion of area treated with insecticides) in Canada's expansive agricultural landscapes are due, in part, to shifts toward more simplified landscapes. To assess this relationship, we analyzed data from the Canadian Census of Agriculture spanning 20 years and five censuses (1996-2016) and across 225 census units within four major agricultural regions of Pacific, Prairie, Central and Atlantic Canada. Generalized mixed effect models were used to evaluate if changes in landscape simplification - defined as the proportion of farmland in crops (cereals, oilseeds, pulses and vegetables) - alongside other farming and climatic variables, influenced insecticide applications over time. Bayesian spatial-temporal models were further used to estimate the strength of the relationship with landscape simplification over time. We found that landscape simplification increased in 89% and insecticide applications increased in 70% of the census division spatial units over the 1996-2016 period. Nationally, significant increases in landscape simplification were observed in the two most agriculturally intensive regions of Prairie (from 55 to 63%) and Central (from 51 to 60%) Canada. For both regions, landscape simplification was a strong and significant predictor of higher insecticide applications, even after accounting for important factors such as climate, economics, farm size and land use practices (e.g., area in cash crops and tillage). If current trends continue, we estimated that insecticide applications will increase 10-20% by 2036 as a result of landscape simplification alone. To avoid increased reliance on toxic insecticides, agri-environmental policies need to consider that losing diverse natural habitat can increase insect pest pressure and resistance with negative environmental consequences extending beyond the field.</abstract><url hash="dd3ae6c1">2022.GWF-1.83</url><doi>10.1002/eap.2533</doi><bibkey>Malaj-etal-2022-Increased</bibkey></paper><paper id="84"><title>Assessing hydrological sensitivity of grassland basins in the Canadian Prairies to climate using a basin classification-based virtual modelling approach</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>He</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Shook</last></author><author><first>Balew</first><last>A.

The region has experienced significant warming since the mid-20th century, and continued warming of an additional 2 ∘C by 2050 is expected. This paper aims to enhance understanding of climate controls on Prairie basin hydrology through numerical model experiments. It approaches this by developing a basin-classification-based virtual modelling framework for a portion of the Prairie region and applying the modelling framework to investigate the hydrological sensitivity of one Prairie basin class (High Elevation Grasslands) to changes in climate. High Elevation Grasslands dominate much of central and southern Alberta and parts of south-western Saskatchewan, with outliers in eastern Saskatchewan and western Manitoba. The experiments revealed that High Elevation Grassland snowpacks are highly sensitive to changes in climate but that this varies geographically. Spring maximum snow water equivalent in grasslands decreases 8 % ∘C−1 of warming. Climate scenario simulations indicated that a 2 ∘C increase in temperature requires at least an increase of 20 % in mean annual precipitation for there to be enough additional snowfall to compensate for enhanced melt losses. The sensitivity in runoff is less linear and varies substantially across the study domain: simulations using 6 ∘C of warming, and a 30 % increase in mean annual precipitation yields simulated decreases in annual runoff of 40 % in climates of the western Prairie but 55 % increases in climates of eastern portions. These results can be used to identify those areas of the region that are most sensitive to climate change and highlight focus areas for monitoring and adaptation. The results also demonstrate how a basin classification-based virtual modelling framework can be applied to evaluate regional-scale impacts of climate change with relatively high spatial resolution in a robust, effective and efficient manner.

The Canadian Rockies are a triple-continental divide, whose high mountains are drained by major snow-fed and rain-fed rivers flowing to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The objective of the April-June 2019 Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was to determine the atmospheric processes producing precipitation on the eastern and western sides of the Canadian Rockies during springtime, a period when upslope events of variable phase dominate precipitation on the eastern slopes. To do so, three observing sites across the divide were instrumented with advanced meteorological sensors. During the 13 observed events, the western side recorded only 25% of the eastern side’s precipitation accumulation, rainfall occurred rather than snowfall, and skies were mainly clear. Moisture sources and amounts varied markedly between events. An atmospheric river landfall in California led to moisture flowing persistently northward and producing the longest duration of precipitation on both sides of the divide. Moisture from the continental interior always produced precipitation on the eastern side but only in specific conditions on the western side. Mainly slow-falling ice crystals, sometimes rimed, formed at higher elevations on the eastern side (&gt; 3 km MSL), were lifted, and subsequently drifted westward over the divide during non-convective storms to produce rain at the surface on the western side. Overall, precipitation generally crossed the divide in the Canadian Rockies during specific spring-storm atmospheric conditions although amounts at the surface varied with elevation, condensate type, and local and large-scale flow fields.</abstract><url hash="345943f4">2022.GWF-1.85</url><doi>10.1175/bams-d-21-0146.1</doi><bibkey>Thériault-etal-2022-Storms</bibkey></paper><paper id="86"><title>Diagnosing Changes in Glacier Hydrology from Physical Principles using a Hydrological Model with Snow Redistribution, Sublimation, Firnification and Energy Balance Ablation Algorithms</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Pradhananga</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract /><url hash="ad50124e">2022.GWF-1.86</url><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127545</doi><bibkey>Pradhananga-etal-2022-Diagnosing</bibkey></paper><paper id="87"><title>Accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western Canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Bevington</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><abstract /><url hash="da5722d8">2022.GWF-1.87</url><doi>10.1016/j.rse.2021.112862</doi><bibkey>Bevington-etal-2022-Accelerated</bibkey></paper><paper id="88"><title>Quantifying relative contributions of source waters from a subalpine wetland to downstream water bodies</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Hathaway</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rooney</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Langs</last></author><abstract>Subalpine regions of the Canadian Rocky Mountains are expected to experience continued changes in hydrometeorological processes due to anthropogenically mediated climate warming. As a result, fresh water supplies are at risk as snowmelt periods occur earlier in the year, and glaciers contribute less annual meltwater, resulting in longer growing seasons and greater reliance on rainfall to generate runoff. In such environments, wetlands are potentially important components that control runoff processes, but due to their location and harsh climates their hydrology is not well studied. We used stable water isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (δ2H and δ18O), coupled with MixSIAR, a Bayesian mixing model, to understand relative source water contributions and mixing within Burstall Wetland, a subalpine wetland (1900 m a.s.l.), and the larger Burstall Valley. These results were combined with climate data from the Burstall Valley to understand hydrometeorological controls on Burstall Wetland source water dynamics over spatiotemporal timescales. Our results show that the seasonal isotopic patterns within Burstall Wetland reflect greater reliance on snowmelt in spring and rainfall in the peak and post‐growing season periods. We found a substantial degree of mixing between precipitation (rain and snow) and stored waters in the landscape, especially during the pre‐growing season. These findings suggest that longer growing seasons in subalpine snow‐dominated landscapes put wetlands at risk of significant water loss and increased evaporation rates potentially leading to periods of reduced runoff during the peak‐ growing season and in extreme cases, wetland dry out.</abstract><url hash="4ae83f49">2022.GWF-1.88</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14679</doi><bibkey>Hathaway-etal-2022-Quantifying</bibkey></paper><paper id="89"><title>Using Stable Water Isotopes to Analyze Spatiotemporal Variability and Hydrometeorological Forcing in Mountain Valley Wetlands</title><author><first>Julia</first><last>M.

However, it is currently not clear how climate trends will impact wetland hydrological processes (e.g., evaporative fluxes) across spatiotemporal scales. Therefore, identifying the factors that influence wetland hydrologic response to climate change is an important step in understanding the sensitivity of these ecosystems to environmental change. We used stable water isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (δ2H and δ18O), coupled with climate data, to determine the spatiotemporal variability in isotopic signatures of wetland source waters and understand the influence of evaporative fluxes on wetlands in the Kananaskis Valley. Our results show that the primary runoff generation mechanism changes throughout the growing season resulting in considerable mixing in wetland surface waters. We found that evaporative fluxes increased with decreasing elevation and that isotopic values became further removed from meteoric water lines during the late peak- and into the post-growing seasons. These findings suggest that a change in the water balance in favor of enhanced evaporation (due to a warmer and longer summer season than present) will not only lead to greater water loss from the wetlands themselves but may also reduce the water inputs from their catchments.</abstract><url hash="3def0fdf">2022.GWF-1.89</url><doi>10.3390/w14111815</doi><bibkey>M.

There are many approaches to, and rationales for, catchment classification, with those focused on streamflow often seeking to relate a particular response characteristic to a physical property or climatic driver. Rationales include such topics as prediction in ungauged basins (PUB), and providing guidance for model selection in poorly understood hydrological systems. The annual daily hydrograph (ADH) is a first‐order easily visualized integrated expression of catchment function, and over many years the average ADH is a distinct hydrological signature that differentiate catchments from each other. In this study, we use t‐SNE, a state‐of‐the‐art technique of dimensionality reduction, to classify 17 110 ADHs for 304 reference catchments in mountainous Western North America. t‐SNE is chosen over other conventional methods of dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) as it presents greater separability of ADHs, which are projected on a 2D map where the similarities are evaluated according to their map distance. We then utilize a Deep Learning encoder to upgrade the non‐parametric t‐SNE to a parametric approach, enhancing its capability to address ‘unseen’ samples. Results showed that t‐SNE successfully clustered ADHs of similar flow regimes on the 2D map and allowed more accurate classification with KNN. In addition, many compact clusters on the 2D map in the coastal Pacific Northwest suggest information redundancy in the local streamflow network. The t‐SNE map provides an intuitive way to visualize the similarity of high‐dimensional data of ADHs, groups catchments with like characteristics, and avoids the reliance on subjective hydrometric indicators.</abstract><url hash="2a2fb6ac">2022.GWF-1.91</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14473</doi><bibkey>Tang-etal-2022-Classifying</bibkey></paper><paper id="92"><title>Material Legacies and Environmental Constraints Underlie Fire Resilience of a Dominant Boreal Forest Type</title><author><first>N.</first><last>J.

This approach can be valuable for various reasons. When used to analyze pre-existing texts, this method allows researchers to conduct studies they might otherwise not be able to complete. Some researchers may not have the resources or time needed to do field research. Although videoconferencing technology and other types of software can be used to reduce some of the obstacles qualitative researchers sometimes encounter, these tools are associated with various problems. Participants might be unskillful in using technology or may not be able to afford it. Conducting a document analysis can also reduce some of the ethical concerns associated with other qualitative methods. Since document analysis is a valuable research method, one would expect to find a wide variety of literature on this topic. Unfortunately, the literature on documentary research is scant. This paper is designed to close the gap in the literature on conducting a qualitative document analysis by focusing on the advantages and limitations of using documents as a source of data and providing strategies for selecting documents.
