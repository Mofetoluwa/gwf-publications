Conventional oil and gas production (e.g., enhanced oil recovery [EOR]), which has been occurring for more than a century in some areas of North America, shares the same environmental concerns, but has received comparatively little attention. Here, we compare the amount of produced water versus saltwater disposal (SWD) and injection for EOR in several prolific hydrocarbon producing regions in the United States and Canada. The total volume of saline and fresh to brackish water injected into depleted oil fields and nonproductive formations is greater than the total volume of produced waters in most regions. The addition of fresh to brackish “makeup” water for EOR may account for the net gain of subsurface water. The total amount of water injected and produced for conventional oil and gas production is greater than that associated with HVHF and unconventional oil and gas production by well over a factor of 10. Reservoir pressure increases from EOR and SWD wells are low compared to injection of fluids for HVHF, however, the longer duration of injections could allow for greater solute transport distances and potential for contamination. Attention should be refocused from the subsurface environmental impacts of HVHF to the oil and gas industry as a whole.</abstract><url hash="b147b4ba">2019.GWF-1.2</url><doi>10.1111/gwat.12917</doi><bibkey>McIntosh-etal-2019-Conventional</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Target Self-enhanced Selectivity in Metal-specific DNAzymes.</title><author><first>P.</first><last>J.

The quantitative and probabilistic forecasting models were generalized additive models (GAMs), whereas the classification forecast used the random forest machine learning method. We found that for the quantitative forecasting models, five of the eight predictors (the day of week, day of the year, water vapor density, wind speed, and previous day’s ozone measurement) were significant at the α = 0.001 level for all urban areas, whereas the other three varied in significance according to the location. The quantitative forecasting for the 2016 ozone season agreed well with the associated measurements (R2 of ~0.70), but it tended to under-predict the ozone level for the days with the highest concentrations. By contrast, the probabilistic forecasting models showed little accuracy in determining the probability of concentrations exceeding policy-relevant thresholds during this season. The success rate for the random forest classification models typically exceeded 75% and would likely increase if the training data sets contained more extreme events.</abstract><url hash="5824118f">2019.GWF-1.4</url><doi>10.4209/aaqr.2018.12.0464</doi><bibkey>Pernak-etal-2019-Forecasting</bibkey></paper><paper id="5"><title>Improving Precipitation Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Network</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Pan</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Hsu</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Aghakouchak</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Sorooshian</last></author><abstract>Precipitation process is generally considered to be poorly represented in numerical weather/climate models. Statistical downscaling (SD) methods, which relate precipitation with model resolved dynamics, often provide more accurate precipitation estimates compared to model's raw precipitation products. We introduce the convolutional neural network model to foster this aspect of SD for daily precipitation prediction. Specifically, we restrict the predictors to the variables that are directly resolved by discretizing the atmospheric dynamics equations. In this sense, our model works as an alternative to the existing precipitation‐related parameterization schemes for numerical precipitation estimation. We train the model to learn precipitation‐related dynamical features from the surrounding dynamical fields by optimizing a hierarchical set of spatial convolution kernels. We test the model at 14 geogrid points across the contiguous United States. Results show that provided with enough data, precipitation estimates from the convolutional neural network model outperform the reanalysis precipitation products, as well as SD products using linear regression, nearest neighbor, random forest, or fully connected deep neural network. Evaluation for the test set suggests that the improvements can be seamlessly transferred to numerical weather modeling for improving precipitation prediction. Based on the default network, we examine the impact of the network architectures on model performance. Also, we offer simple visualization and analyzing approaches to interpret the models and their results. Our study contributes to the following two aspects: First, we offer a novel approach to enhance numerical precipitation estimation; second, the proposed model provides important implications for improving precipitation‐related parameterization schemes using a data‐driven approach.</abstract><url hash="2f232119">2019.GWF-1.5</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR024090</doi><bibkey>Pan-etal-2019-Improving</bibkey></paper><paper id="6"><title>Incorporating social dimensions in hydrological and water quality modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural beneficial management practices in a Prairie River Basin</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Bradford</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Thapa</last></author><author><first>Ashleigh</first><last>Duffy</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Hassanzadeh</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Strickert</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Noble</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b62a70a3">2019.GWF-1.6</url><doi>10.1007/s11356-019-06325-1</doi><bibkey>Bradford-etal-2019-Incorporating</bibkey></paper><paper id="7"><title>“Spirit, Safety, and a Stand-off ”: The Research-Creation Process and Its Roles in Relationality and Reconciliation among Researcher and Indigenous Co-Learners in Saskatchewan, Canada</title><author><first>Myron</first><last>Neapetung</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bradford</last></author><author><first>Lalita</first><last>Bharadwaj</last></author><abstract>Provision of safe water on reserves is an ongoing problem in Canada that can be addressed by mobilizing water knowledge across diverse platforms to a variety of audiences. A participatory artistic animation video on the lived experiences of Elderswith water in Yellow Quill First Nation, Treaty Four territory, was created to mobilize knowledge beyond conventional peer-review channels. Research findings from interviews with 22 Elders were translated through a collaborative process into a video with a storytelling format that harmonized narratives, visual arts, music, and meaningful symbols. Three themes emerged which centered on the spirituality of water, the survival need for water, and standoffs in water management. The translation process, engagement and video output were evaluated using an autoethnographic approach with two members of the research team. We demonstrate how the collaborative research process and co-created video enhance community-based participatory knowledge translation and sharing. We also express how the video augments First Nations community ownership, control, access and possession (OCAP) of research information that aligns with their storytelling traditions and does so in a youth-friendly, e-compatible form. Through the evaluative process we share lessons learned about the value and effectiveness of the video as a tool for fostering partnerships, and reconciliation. The benefits and positive impacts of the video for the Yellow Quill community and for community members are discussed.</abstract><url hash="c12d4035">2019.GWF-1.7</url><doi>10.15402/ESJ.V5I2.68334</doi><bibkey>Neapetung-etal-2019-“Spirit,</bibkey></paper><paper id="8"><title>Reclaiming Indigenous Planning as a Pathway to Local Water Security</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Patrick</last></author><author><first>Kellie</first><last>Grant</last></author><author><first>Lalita</first><last>Bharadwaj</last></author><abstract>Access to drinkable water is essential to human life. The consequence of unsafe drinking water can be damaging to communities and catastrophic to human health. Today, one in five First Nation communities in Canada is on a boil water advisory, with some advisories lasting over 10 years. Factors contributing to this problem stretch back to colonial structures and institutional arrangement that reproduce woefully inadequate community drinking water systems. Notwithstanding these challenges, First Nation communities remain diligent, adaptive, and innovative in their efforts to provide drinkable water to their community members. One example is through the practice of source water protection planning. Source water is untreated water from groundwater or surface water that supplies drinking water for human consumption. Source water protection is operationalized through land and water planning activities aimed at reducing the risk of contamination from entering a public drinking water supply. Here, we introduce a source water protection planning process at Muskowekwan First Nation, Treaty 4, Saskatchewan. The planning process followed a community-based participatory approach guided by trust, respect, and reciprocity between community members and university researchers. Community members identified threats to the drinking water source followed by restorative land management actions to reduce those threats. The result of this process produced much more than a planning document but engaged multiple community members in a process of empowerment and self-determination. The process of plan-making produced many unintended results including human–land connectivity, reconnection with the water spirit, as well as the reclaiming of indigenous planning. Source water protection planning may not correct all the current water system inadequacies that exist on many First Nations, but it will empower communities to take action to protect their drinking water sources for future generations as a pathway to local water security.</abstract><url hash="51925da4">2019.GWF-1.8</url><doi>10.3390/W11050936</doi><bibkey>Patrick-etal-2019-Reclaiming</bibkey></paper><paper id="9"><title>“Garbage in, Garbage Out” Does Not Hold True for Indigenous Community Flood Extent Modeling in the Prairie Pothole Region</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Thapa</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bradford</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Strickert</last></author><author><first>Xiaolei</first><last>Yu</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Johnston</last></author><author><first>Kelsey</first><last>Watson-Daniels</last></author><abstract>Extensive land use changes and uncertainties arising from climate change in recent years have contributed to increased flood magnitudes in the Canadian Prairies and threatened the vulnerabilities of many small and indigenous communities. There is, thus, a need to create modernized flood risk management tools to support small and rural communities’ preparations for future extreme events. In this study, we developed spatial flood information for an indigenous community in Central Saskatchewan using LiDAR based DEM and a spatial modeling tool, the wetland DEM ponding model (WDPM). A crucial element of flood mapping in this study was community engagement in data collection, scenario description for WDPM, and flood map validation. Community feedback was also used to evaluate the utility of the modelled flood outputs. The results showed the accuracy of WDPM outputs could be improved not only with the quality of DEM but also with additional community-held information on contributing areas (watershed information). Based on community feedback, this accessible, spatially-focused modeling approach can provide relevant information for community spatial planning and developing risk management strategies. Our study found community engagement to be valuable in flood modeling and mapping by: providing necessary data, validating input data through lived experiences, and providing alternate scenarios to be used in future work. This research demonstrates the suitability and utility of LiDAR and WDPM complemented by community participation for improving flood mapping in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). The approach used in the study also serves as an important guide for applying transdisciplinary tools and methods for establishing good practice in research and helping build resilient communities in the Prairies.</abstract><url hash="26956d32">2019.GWF-1.9</url><doi>10.3390/w11122486</doi><bibkey>Thapa-etal-2019-“Garbage</bibkey></paper><paper id="10"><title>Biomic river restoration: A new focus for river management</title><author><first>Matthew</first><last>F.

In response, there has been a paradigm shift in management over the past few decades, towards river restoration. But the ecological, morphological, and societal benefits of river restoration have, on the whole, been disappointing. We believe that this stems from the fact that restoration overrelies on the same physical analyses and approaches, with flowing water still regarded as the universally predominant driver of channel form and structural intervention seen as essential to influencing fluvial processes. We argue that if river restoration is to reverse long‐standing declines in river functions, it is necessary to recognize the influence of biology on river forms and processes and re‐envisage what it means to restore a river. This entails shifting the focus of river restoration from designing and constructing stable channels that mimic natural forms to reconnecting streams within balanced and healthy biomes, and so levering the power of biology to influence river processes. We define this new approach as biomic river restoration.</abstract><url hash="f4f391c4">2019.GWF-1.10</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3529</doi><bibkey>F.

Permafrost strongly controls hydrological processes in cold regions, and our understanding of how changes in seasonal and perennial frozen ground disposition and linked storage dynamics affects runoff generation processes remains limited. Storage dynamics and water redistribution are influenced by the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of frozen ground, snow accumulation and melt. Stable isotopes provide a potentially useful technique to quantify the dynamics of water sources, flow paths and ages; yet few studies have employed isotope data in permafrost-influenced catchments. Here, we applied the conceptual model STARR (Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall-Runoff model), which facilitates fully distributed simulations of hydrological storage dynamics and runoff processes, isotopic composition and water ages. We adapted this model to a subarctic catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada, with a time-variable implementation of field capacity to include the influence of thaw dynamics. A multi-criteria calibration based on stream flow, snow water equivalent and isotopes was applied to three years of data. The integration of isotope data in the spatially distributed model provided the basis to quantify spatio-temporal dynamics of water storage and ages, emphasizing the importance of thaw layer dynamics in mixing and damping the melt signal. By using the model conceptualisation of spatially and temporally variant storage, this study demonstrates the ability of tracer-aided modelling to capture thaw layer dynamics that cause mixing and damping of the isotopic melt signal.

water equivalent, streamflow, soil moisture, and water level in a
groundwater well. This dataset was recorded at different elevation bands in
Wolf Creek Research Basin, near Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada,
representing forest, shrub tundra, and alpine tundra biomes from 1993
through 2014. Measurements continue through 2018 and are planned for the

High-latitude environments store approximately half of the global
organic carbon pool in peatlands, organic soils and permafrost, while large
Arctic rivers convey an estimated 18–50 Tg C a−1 to the Arctic Ocean.
Warming trends associated with climate change affect dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) export from terrestrial to riverine environments. However,
there is limited consensus as to whether exports will increase or decrease
due to complex interactions between climate, soils, vegetation, and
associated production, mobilization and transport processes. A large body of
research has focused on large river system DOC and dissolved organic matter (DOM) lability and observed
trends conserved across years, whereas investigation at smaller watershed
scales show that thermokarst and fire have a transient impact on
hydrologically mediated solute transport. This study, located in the Wolf
Creek Research Basin situated ∼20 km south of Whitehorse, YT,
Canada, utilizes a nested design to assess seasonal and annual patterns of
DOC and DOM composition across diverse landscape types (headwater, wetland and lake) and watershed scales. Peak DOC concentration and export occurred
during freshet, as is the case in most northern watersheds; however, peaks were lower than
a decade ago at the headwater site Granger Creek. DOM composition was most
variable during freshet with high A254 and SUVA254 and low FI and BIX. DOM
composition was relatively insensitive to flow variation during summer and
fall. The influence of increasing watershed scale and downstream mixing of
landscape contributions was an overall dampening of DOC concentrations and
optical indices with increasing groundwater contribution. Forecasted
vegetation shifts, enhanced permafrost and seasonal thaw, earlier snowmelt,
increased rainfall and other projected climate-driven changes will alter DOM
sources and transport pathways. The results from this study support a projected shift from
predominantly organic soils (high aromaticity and less fresh) to decomposing
vegetation (more fresh and lower aromaticity). These changes may also
facilitate flow and transport via deeper flow pathways and enhance
groundwater contributions to runoff.

Streich</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Mountain fens are limited in their spatial extent but are vital ecosystems for biodiversity, habitat, and carbon and water cycling. Studies of fen hydrological function in northern regions indicate the timing and magnitude of runoff is variable, with atmospheric and environmental conditions playing key roles in runoff production. How the complex ecohydrological processes of mountain fens that govern water storage and release as well as peat accumulation will respond to a warmer and less snowy future climate is unclear. To provide insight, we studied the hydrological processes and function of Sibbald fen, located at the low end of the known elevation range in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, over a dry period. We added an evapotranspiration function to the Spence hydrological function method to better account for storage loss. When frozen in spring and early summer, the fen primarily transmits water. When thawed, the fen's hydrological function switches from water transmission to water release, leading to a summertime water table decline of nearly 1 m. Rainfall events larger than 5 mm can transiently switch fen hydrological function to storage, followed by contribution, depending on antecedent conditions. The evapotranspiration function was dominant only for a brief period in late June and early July when rainfall was low and the ground was still partially frozen, even though evapotranspiration accounted for the largest loss of storage from the system. This research highlights the mechanisms by which mountain peatlands supply baseflow during drought conditions, and the importance of frozen ground and rainfall in regulating their hydrological function. The study has important implications for the sustainability of low elevation mountain fens under climate change.</abstract><url hash="f39e55dd">2019.GWF-1.14</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13579</doi><bibkey>C.

Here, a comprehensive review of the design guidelines of TENGs, their performance, and their designs in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is presented. The development stages of TENGs in large‐scale self‐powered systems and technological applications enabled by harvesting energy from water waves or wind energy sources are also reviewed. This self‐powered capability is essential considering that IoT applications should be capable of operation anywhere and anytime, supported by a network of energy harvesting systems in arbitrary environments. In addition, this review paper investigates the development of self‐charging power units (SCPUs), which can be realized by pairing TENGs with energy storage devices, such as batteries and capacitors. Consequently, different designs of power management circuits, supercapacitors, and batteries that can be integrated with TENG devices are also reviewed. Finally, the significant factors that need to be addressed when designing and optimizing TENG‐based systems for energy harvesting and self‐powered sensing applications are discussed.</abstract><url hash="fa2819f6">2019.GWF-1.18</url><doi>10.1002/advs.201802230</doi><bibkey>Ahmed-etal-2019-Integrated</bibkey></paper><paper id="19"><title>All printable snow-based triboelectric nanogenerator.</title><author><first>Abdelsalam</first><last>Ahmed</last></author><author><first>Islam</first><last>Hassan</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Mosa</last></author><author><first>Esraa</first><last>Elsanadidy</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Phadke</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>El‐Kady</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Rusling</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Kaner</last></author><abstract /><url hash="8d2f2960">2019.GWF-1.19</url><doi>10.1016/J.NANOEN.2019.03.032</doi><bibkey>Ahmed-etal-2019-All</bibkey></paper><paper id="20"><title>Effects of Damming on River Nitrogen Fluxes: A Global Analysis</title><author><first>Zahra</first><last>Akbarzadeh</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Maavara</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Slowinski</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Van Cappellen</last></author><abstract>Damming creates biogeochemical hotspots along rivers that modify the riverine flow of nutrients, including nitrogen (N). Here, we quantify the impact of dams on global riverine N fluxes using a reservoir N mass balance model. In‐reservoir processes represented in the model include primary production, mineralization of organic N, denitrification, and sedimentary burial. In addition, we explicitly account for N fixation as a source of N, assuming that the N to phosphorus (P) ratio of the inflow regulates the magnitude of N fixation in reservoirs. The model is scaled up via a Monte Carlo analysis that yields global relationships between N elimination in reservoirs, either by denitrification or burial, and the hydraulic residence time. These relationships are then combined with N loads to the world's dam reservoirs generated by the Global‐NEWS model and the estimated N fixation fluxes. According to the results, in year 2000, worldwide N fixation in reservoirs was on the order of 70 Gmol yr−1, while denitrification and burial in reservoirs eliminated around 270 Gmol yr−1, equal to 7% of N loading to the global river network. The latter is predicted to double to 14% by 2030, mainly as a result of the current boom in dam building. The results further imply that, largely due to N fixation in reservoirs, damming causes a global upward shift in riverine N:P ratios, thus lessening N limitation in receiving water bodies.</abstract><url hash="dfdec207">2019.GWF-1.20</url><doi>10.1029/2019GB006222</doi><bibkey>Akbarzadeh-etal-2019-Effects</bibkey></paper><paper id="21"><title>Electrochemical sensing of lead in drinking water using β-cyclodextrin-modified MWCNTs</title><author><first>Arif</first><last>Ul Alam</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Howlader</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Hu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Deen</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a8d9f291">2019.GWF-1.21</url><doi>10.1016/J.SNB.2019.126632</doi><bibkey>Ul Alam-etal-2019-Electrochemical</bibkey></paper><paper id="22"><title>Cryptic phenology in plants: Case studies, implications, and recommendations</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Albert</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Restrepo-Coupe</last></author><author><first>Marielle</first><last>N.

Traditionally studied phenologies are readily apparent, such as flowering events, germination timing, and season‐initiating budbreak. However, a broad range of phenologies that are fundamental to the ecology and evolution of plants, and to global biogeochemical cycles and climate change predictions, have been neglected because they are “cryptic”—that is, hidden from view (e.g., root production) or difficult to distinguish and interpret based on common measurements at typical scales of examination (e.g., leaf turnover in evergreen forests). We illustrate how capturing cryptic phenology can advance scientific understanding with two case studies: wood phenology in a deciduous forest of the northeastern USA and leaf phenology in tropical evergreen forests of Amazonia. Drawing on these case studies and other literature, we argue that conceptualizing and characterizing cryptic plant phenology is needed for understanding and accurate prediction at many scales from organisms to ecosystems. We recommend avenues of empirical and modeling research to accelerate discovery of cryptic phenological patterns, to understand their causes and consequences, and to represent these processes in terrestrial biosphere models.</abstract><url hash="31d0a32b">2019.GWF-1.22</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14759</doi><bibkey>Albert-etal-2019-Cryptic</bibkey></paper><paper id="23"><title>Modelling farmer choices for water security measures in the Litani river basin in Lebanon.</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Alcon</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Tapsuwan</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Yunes</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Mounzer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>de-Miguel</last></author><abstract /><url hash="46d793bd">2019.GWF-1.23</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.410</doi><bibkey>Alcon-etal-2019-Modelling</bibkey></paper><paper id="24"><title>Comparison of the Effects of Extraction Techniques on Mass Spectrometry Profiles of Dissolved Organic Compounds in Oil Sand Process-Affected Water</title><author><first>Hattan</first><last>A.

is an important issue over the southern Canadian Cordillera. This issue is
examined from January to April of 2010 by exploiting the high-resolution
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model Version 3.4.1 dataset that was
used to simulate both a historical reanalysis-driven (control – CTRL) and a
pseudo-global-warming (PGW) experiment (Liu et al., 2016). Transition
regions, consisting of both liquid and solid precipitation or liquid
precipitation below 0 ∘C, occurred on 93 % and 94 % of the
days in the present and PGW future, respectively. This led to accumulated
precipitation within the transition region increasing by 27 % and was
associated with a rise in its average elevation by 374 m over the Coast Mountains and
Insular Mountains and by 240 m over the Rocky Mountains and consequently to
an eastward shift towards the higher terrain of the Rocky Mountains.
Transition regions comprised of only rain and snow were most common under
both the CTRL and PGW simulations, although all seven transition region
categories occurred. Transition region changes would enhance some of the
factors leading to avalanches and would also impact ski resort operations.

The concept of environmental flows provides a framework for improving understanding of relationships between river flows and people, and for supporting those that are mutually beneficial. Nevertheless, most approaches to determining environmental flows remain grounded in the biophysical sciences. The newly revised Brisbane Declaration and Global Action Agenda on Environmental Flows (2018) represents a new phase in environmental flow science and an opportunity to better consider the co‐constitution of river flows, ecosystems, and society, and to more explicitly incorporate these relationships into river management. We synthesize understanding of relationships between people and rivers as conceived under the renewed definition of environmental flows. We present case studies from Honduras, India, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia that illustrate multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts where recognizing and meeting diverse flow needs of human populations was central to establishing environmental flow recommendations. We also review a small body of literature to highlight examples of the diversity and interdependencies of human‐flow relationships—such as the linkages between river flow and human well‐being, spiritual needs, cultural identity, and sense of place—that are typically overlooked when environmental flows are assessed and negotiated. Finally, we call for scientists and water managers to recognize the diversity of ways of knowing, relating to, and utilizing rivers, and to place this recognition at the center of future environmental flow assessments.</abstract><url hash="41ba57a4">2019.GWF-1.27</url><doi>10.1002/wat2.1381</doi><bibkey>Anderson-etal-2019-Understanding</bibkey></paper><paper id="28"><title>Comparative valuation of potential and realized ecosystem services in Southern Ontario, Canada</title><author><first>T.</first><last>Aziz</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Van Cappellen</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d1054a35">2019.GWF-1.28</url><doi>10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2019.06.014</doi><bibkey>Aziz-etal-2019-Comparative</bibkey></paper><paper id="29"><title>Soil and water management: opportunities to mitigate nutrient losses to surface waters in the Northern Great Plains</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Cordeiro</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Flaten</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><abstract>The Northern Great Plains is a key region to global food production.

 Recently dam managers have begun to use data produced by regional climate models to estimate how probable maximum precipitation (PMP) might evolve in the future. Before accomplishing such a task, it is essential to assess PMP estimates derived from regional climate models (RCMs). In the current study PMP over North America estimated from two Canadian RCMs, CanRCM4 and CRCM5, is compared with estimates derived from three reanalysis products: ERA-Interim, NARR, and CFSR. An additional hybrid dataset (MSWEP-ERA) produced by combining precipitation from the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset and precipitable water (PW) from ERA-Interim is also considered to derive PMP estimates that can serve as a reference. A recently developed approach using a statistical bivariate extreme values distribution is used to provide a probabilistic description of the PMP estimates using the moisture maximization method. Such a probabilistic description naturally allows an assessment of PMP estimates that includes quantification of their uncertainty. While PMP estimates based on the two RCMs exhibit spatial patterns similar to those of MSWEP-ERA and the three sets of reanalyses on the continental scale over North America, CanRCM4 has a tendency for overestimation while CRCM5 has a tendency for modest underestimation. Generally, CRCM5 shows good agreement with ERA-Interim, while CanRCM4 is more comparable to CFSR. Overall, the good ability of the two RCMs to reproduce the major characteristics of the different components involved in the estimation of PMP suggests that they may be useful tools for PMP estimation that could serve as a basis for flood studies at the basin scale.</abstract><url hash="c6c5f346">2019.GWF-1.30</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-18-0233.1</doi><bibkey>Alaya-etal-2019-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="31"><title>Probable maximum precipitation in a warming climate over North America in CanRCM4 and CRCM5</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Ben Alaya</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b1c2c3d0">2019.GWF-1.31</url><doi>10.1007/s10584-019-02591-7</doi><bibkey>Ben Alaya-etal-2019-Probable</bibkey></paper><paper id="32"><title>Quantifying Process Connectivity With Transfer Entropy in Hydrologic Models</title><author><first>Andrew</first><last>R.

We argue that classical error measures do not offer a complete picture for building this understanding. This study demonstrates how the information theoretic measure known as transfer entropy can be used to quantify the active transfer of information between hydrologic processes at various timescales and facilitate further understanding of the behavior of these systems. To build a better understanding of the differences in dynamics, we compare model instances of the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA), the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) across a variety of hydrologic regimes in the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Our results show differences in the runoff of the SUMMA instance compared to the other two models in several of our study locations. In the Snake River region, SUMMA runoff was primarily snowmelt driven, while VIC and PRMS runoff was primarily influenced by precipitation and evapotranspiration. In the Olympic mountains, evapotranspiration interacted with the other water balance variables much differently in PRMS than in VIC and SUMMA. In the Willamette River, all three models had similar process networks at the daily time scale but showed differences in information transfer at the monthly timescale. Additionally, we find that all three models have similar connectivity between evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Analyzing information transfers to runoff at daily and monthly time steps shows how processes can operate on different timescales. By comparing information transfer with correlations, we show how transfer entropy provides a complementary picture of model behavior.</abstract><url hash="28cb926a">2019.GWF-1.32</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR024555</doi><bibkey>R.

Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate’s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE.</abstract><url hash="5fcca2fc">2019.GWF-1.33</url><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0211510</doi><bibkey>Besnard-etal-2019-Memory</bibkey></paper><paper id="34"><title>Twenty-three unsolved problems in hydrology (UPH) – a community perspective</title><author><first>G.</first><last>Blöschl</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Bierkens</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Chambel</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Cudennec</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Destouni</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Fiori</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Kirchner</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Savenije</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Sivapalan</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Stumpp</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Toth</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Volpi</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Carr</last></author><author><first>Claire</first><last>Lupton</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Salinas</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Széles</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Viglione</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Aksoy</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Allen</last></author><author><first>Anam</first><last>Amin</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Andréassian</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Arheimer</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Aryal</last></author><author><first>V.</first><last>Baker</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Bardsley</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Barendrecht</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Bartošová</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Batelaan</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Berghuijs</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Beven</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Blume</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Bogaard</last></author><author><first>Pablo</first><last>Borges de Amorim</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Böttcher</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Boulet</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Breinl</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Brilly</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Brocca</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Buytaert</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Castellarin</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Castelletti</last></author><author><first>Xiaohong</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Yangbo</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Yuan-Chao</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Chifflard</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Claps</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Collins</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Croke</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Dathe</last></author><author><first>Paula</first><last>C.

The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.</abstract><url hash="c1a8375f">2019.GWF-1.34</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2019.1620507</doi><bibkey>Blöschl-etal-2019-Twenty-three</bibkey></paper><paper id="35"><title>On the Role of a Large Shallow Lake (Lake St. Clair, USA‐Canada) in Modulating Phosphorus Loads to Lake Erie</title><author><first>Serghei</first><last>A.

Where this is not the case, it impacts understanding and predicting consequences of nutrient load reductions, both for the water body and for those downstream of it. We applied a three‐dimensional ecological model to a large shallow lake, Lake St. Clair (US/Canada), to quantify the total and dissolved reactive phosphorus (TP and DRP) transport and retention, and construct tributary‐specific relationships between phosphorus load to the lake and the amount of phosphorus that leaves the lake for the three major tributaries. Lake St. Clair is situated between the St. Clair and Detroit rivers, the latter enters Lake Erie. Efforts to reduce Lake Erie's re‐eutrophication requires an understanding of nutrient transport and retention in each of its subwatersheds including those that feed indirectly via Lake St. Clair. We found that over the simulation period, the lake retained a significant portion of TP (17%) and DRP (35%) load and that TP and DRP retention was spatially variable and largely controlled by a combination of lake depth, resuspension, and plankton uptake. Compared to the Clinton and Sydenham rivers, the Thames River contributed a larger proportion of its load to the lake's outflow. However, because the lake's load is dominated by the St. Clair River, 40% reductions of nutrients from those subwatersheds will result in less than a 5% reduction in the load to Lake Erie.</abstract><url hash="b6af07c9">2019.GWF-1.35</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025019</doi><bibkey>A.

Interpolating daily precipitation, one of the inputs for the Fire Weather Index System is a key challenge in areas without sufficient weather stations. This work evaluates the performance of gridded precipitation from the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) System and six interpolation methods to achieve the best fire danger rating in Alberta, Canada. Results show that the CaPA System has only average performance due to limited radar coverage (10%) in the forested region; however, using the CaPA System as a covariate with regression kriging generates significantly better precipitation estimates. Ordinary kriging, regression kriging with elevation as a covariate, and the thin‐plate smoothed spline are methods with similar performance. Fuel moisture codes of the Fire Weather Index System respond differently to precipitation amounts due to differences in their time constants for drying. Fine fuels with a short drying time (Fine Fuel Moisture Code) are best estimated by the CaPA System because of its enhanced skill in estimating small precipitation events. Compacted organic fuels with longer drying times (Duff Moisture Code and Drought Code) are best estimated by regression kriging with CaPA because it better predicts significant precipitation events. The dense fire weather station network in our study area (~3.0 stations/10,000 km2) allows us to perform a sensitivity analysis, and we find that a threshold of &gt;0.5 stations/10,000 km2 is needed for regression kriging with CaPA to become appreciably better than the CaPA System.</abstract><url hash="2fa65673">2019.GWF-1.36</url><doi>10.1029/2018JD028754</doi><bibkey>Cai-etal-2019-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="37"><title>Hydrological and Seasonal Controls of Phosphorus in Northern Great Plains Agricultural Streams.</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Casson</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>M. Higgins</last></author><abstract>Controls on nutrient transport in cold, low-relief agricultural regions vary dramatically among seasons. The spring snowmelt is often the dominant runoff and nutrient loading event of the year. However, climate change may increase the proportion of runoff occurring with rainfall, and there is an urgent need to understand seasonal controls on nutrient transport to understand how patterns may change in the future. In this study, we assess patterns and drivers of total P (TP) dynamics in eight streams draining agriculturally dominated watersheds, located in southern Manitoba, Canada. Data from three years of monitoring revealed highly coherent patterns of TP concentrations in streams, with pronounced peaks in the spring and midsummer across the region. This coherent pattern was in spite of considerable interannual variability in the magnitude and timing of discharge; in particular, a major storm event occurred in summer 2014, which resulted in more discharge than the preceding spring melt. Concentration-discharge model fits were generally poor or not significant, suggesting that runoff generation is not the primary driver of TP dynamics in the majority of streams. Seasonal patterns of conductivity and stream temperature suggest that mechanisms controlling TP vary by season; a spring TP concentration maximum may be related to surface runoff over frozen soils, whereas the summer TP maximum may be related to temperature-driven biogeochemical processes, which are not well represented in current conceptual or predictive models. These findings suggest that controls on stream TP concentrations are dynamic through the year, and responses to increases in dormant and nondormant season temperatures may depend on seasonally variable processes.</abstract><url hash="58a166e5">2019.GWF-1.37</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.07.0281</doi><bibkey>Casson-etal-2019-Hydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="38"><title>Atmospheric circulation amplifies shift of winter streamflow in southern Ontario</title><author><first>Olivier</first><last>Champagne</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>A.

Several studies link interannual variability in GMSL to anomalous transport of water mass between land and ocean—and subsequent changes in water storage in these reservoirs—primarily driven by El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Despite this, asymmetries in teleconnections between ENSO mode and land water storage have received less attention. We use historical simulations of natural climate variability to characterize asymmetries in the hydrological response to ENSO based on phase and duration. Findings indicate pronounced phase-specific and duration-specific asymmetries covering up to 93 and 50 million km2 land area, respectively. The asymmetries are seasonally dependent, and based on the mean regional climate are capable of influencing inherently bounded storage by pushing the storage-precipitation relationship towards nonlinearity. The nonlinearities are more pronounced in dry regions in the dry season, wet regions in the wet season, and during Year 2 of persistent ENSO events, limiting the magnitude of associated anomalies under persistent ENSO influence. The findings have implications for a range of stakeholders, including sea level researchers and water managers.</abstract><url hash="bf194be2">2019.GWF-1.39</url><doi>10.3390/w11112249</doi><bibkey>Chandanpurkar-etal-2019-Asymmetric</bibkey></paper><paper id="40"><title>How Do Modeling Decisions Affect the Spread Among Hydrologic Climate Change Projections?

In this study, we investigate the ways in which four different steps in the modeling chain influence the spread in projected changes of different aspects of hydrology. To form the basis of these analyses, we constructed an ensemble of 160 simulations from permutations of two Representative Concentration Pathways, 10 global climate models, two downscaling methods, and four hydrologic model implementations. The study is situated in the Pacific Northwest of North America, which has relevance to a diverse, multinational cast of stakeholders. We analyze the effects of each modeling decision on changes in gridded hydrologic variables of snow water equivalent and runoff, as well as streamflow at point locations. Results show that the choice of representative concentration pathway or global climate model is the driving contributor to the spread in annual streamflow volume and timing. On the other hand, hydrologic model implementation explains most of the spread in changes in low flows. Finally, by grouping the results by climate region the results have the potential to be generalized beyond the Pacific Northwest. Future hydrologic impact assessments can use these results to better tailor their modeling efforts.</abstract><url hash="89846581">2019.GWF-1.40</url><doi>10.1029/2018EF001047</doi><bibkey>Chegwidden-etal-2019-How</bibkey></paper><paper id="41"><title>Using 4-km WRF CONUS simulations to assess impacts of the surface coupling strength on regional climate simulation</title><author><first>Liang</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Fei</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Barlage</last></author><author><first>Zhe</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract /><url hash="fe835517">2019.GWF-1.41</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-019-04932-9</doi><bibkey>Chen-etal-2019-Using</bibkey></paper><paper id="42"><title>Parameterization of the Bulk Liquid Fraction on Mixed-Phase Particles in the Predicted Particle Properties (P3) Scheme: Description and Idealized Simulations</title><author><first>Mélissa</first><last>Cholette</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Morrison</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Milbrandt</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><abstract>
 Bulk microphysics parameterizations that are used to represent clouds and precipitation usually allow only solid and liquid hydrometeors. Predicting the bulk liquid fraction on ice allows an explicit representation of mixed-phase particles and various precipitation types, such as wet snow and ice pellets. In this paper, an approach for the representation of the bulk liquid fraction into the predicted particle properties (P3) microphysics scheme is proposed and described. Solid-phase microphysical processes, such as melting and sublimation, have been modified to account for the liquid component. New processes, such as refreezing and condensation of the liquid portion of mixed-phase particles, have been added to the parameterization. Idealized simulations using a one-dimensional framework illustrate the overall behavior of the modified scheme. The proposed approach compares well to a Lagrangian benchmark model. Temperatures required for populations of ice crystals to melt completely also agree well with previous studies. The new processes of refreezing and condensation impact both the surface precipitation type and feedback between the temperature and the phase changes. Overall, prediction of the bulk liquid fraction allows an explicit description of new precipitation types, such as wet snow and ice pellets, and improves the representation of hydrometeor properties when the temperature is near 0°C.</abstract><url hash="678a04ad">2019.GWF-1.42</url><doi>10.1175/JAS-D-18-0278.1</doi><bibkey>Cholette-etal-2019-Parameterization</bibkey></paper><paper id="43"><title>The initial three years of carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and a reclaimed oil sand wetland</title><author><first>M.</first><last>G.

In the warning, humanity is urged to practice more environmentally sustainable alternatives to business as usual to avoid potentially catastrophic outcomes. Following the success of their warning, the Alliance of World Scientists called for discipline-specific follow-up papers. This paper is an answer to that call for the topic of wildland fire. Across much of Canada and the world, wildfires are anticipated to increase in severity and frequency in response to anthropogenic activities. The world scientists’ second warning provides the opportunity for wildland fire researchers to raise the profile of the potential impacts that anthropogenic activities are likely to have on future fire regimes and, in return, what impacts future fire regimes may have on humanity. We discuss how wildfire is related to several issues of concern raised in the world scientists’ second warning, including climate change, human population growth, biodiversity and forests, and freshwater availability. Furthermore, we touch on the potential future health impacts and challenges to wildfire suppression and management in Canada. In essence, our wildfire scientists’ warning to humanity is that we, as a society, will have to learn to live with more fire on the landscape. We provide some recommendations on how we might move forward to prepare for and adapt to future wildfire regimes in Canada. Although this paper is primarily Canadian in focus, the concepts and information herein also draw from international examples and are of relevance globally.</abstract><url hash="8ee9a198">2019.GWF-1.44</url><doi>10.1139/CJFR-2019-0094</doi><bibkey>C.

In cold Canadian prairie agricultural regions, part of the eutrophication challenge arises during spring snowmelt when a significant portion of the total annual nutrient export occurs, and plant residues can act as a nutrient source instead of a sink. Although the total mass of nutrients released from various crop residues has been studied before, little research has been conducted to capture fine-timescale temporal dynamics of nutrient leaching from plant residues, and the processes have not been represented in water quality models. In this study, we measured the dynamics of P and N release from a cold-hardy perennial plant species, alfalfa ( L.), to meltwater after freeze-thaw through a controlled snowmelt experiment. Various winter conditions were simulated by exposing alfalfa residues to different numbers of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) of uniform magnitude prior to snowmelt. The monitored P and N dynamics showed that most nutrients were released during the initial stages of snowmelt (first 5 h) and that the magnitude of nutrient release was affected by the number of FTCs. A threshold of five FTCs was identified for a greater nutrient release, with plant residue contributing between 0.29 (NO) and 9 (PO) times more nutrients than snow. The monitored temporal dynamics of nutrient release were used to develop the first process-based predictive model controlled by three potentially measurable parameters that can be integrated into catchment water quality models to improve nutrient transport simulations during snowmelt.</abstract><url hash="60e7c0b4">2019.GWF-1.46</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.12.0440</doi><bibkey>Costa-etal-2019-Temporal</bibkey></paper><paper id="47"><title>Using an inverse modelling approach with equifinality control to investigate the dominant controls on snowmelt nutrient export</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Costa</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>There is great interest in modelling the export of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields because of ongoing challenges of eutrophication. However, the use of existing hydrochemistry models can be problematic in cold regions because models frequently employ incomplete or conceptually incorrect representations of the dominant cold regions hydrological processes and are overparameterized, often with insufficient data for validation. Here, a process‐based N model, WINTRA, which is coupled to a physically based cold regions hydrological model, was expanded to simulate P and account for overwinter soil nutrient biochemical cycling. An inverse modelling approach, using this model with consideration of parameter equifinality, was applied to an intensively monitored agricultural basin in Manitoba, Canada, to help identify the main climate, soil, and anthropogenic controls on nutrient export. Consistent with observations, the model results suggest that snow water equivalent, melt rate, snow cover depletion rate, and contributing area for run‐off generation determine the opportunity time and surface area for run‐off–soil interaction. These physical controls have not been addressed in existing models. Results also show that the time lag between the start of snowmelt and the arrival of peak nutrient concentration in run‐off increased with decreasing antecedent soil moisture content, highlighting potential implications of frozen soils on run‐off processes and hydrochemistry. The simulations showed TDP concentration peaks generally arriving earlier than NO3 but also decreasing faster afterwards, which suggests a significant contribution of plant residue Total dissolved Phosphorus (TDP) to early snowmelt run‐off. Antecedent fall tillage and fertilizer application increased TDP concentrations in spring snowmelt run‐off but did not consistently affect NO3 run‐off. In this case, the antecedent soil moisture content seemed to have had a dominant effect on overwinter soil N biogeochemical processes such as mineralization, which are often ignored in models. This work demonstrates both the need for better representation of cold regions processes in hydrochemical models and the model improvements that are possible if these are included.</abstract><url hash="17e0f022">2019.GWF-1.47</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13463</doi><bibkey>Costa-etal-2019-Using</bibkey></paper><paper id="48"><title>Preferential elution of ionic solutes in melting snowpacks: Improving process understanding through field observations and modeling in the Rocky Mountains.</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Costa</last></author><author><first>Graham</first><last>A Sexstone</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>W Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Donald</first><last>H Campbell</last></author><author><first>David</first><last>W Clow</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Mast</last></author><abstract /><url hash="875fedb3">2019.GWF-1.48</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136273</doi><bibkey>Costa-etal-2019-Preferential1</bibkey></paper><paper id="49"><title>Vegetation Functional Properties Determine Uncertainty of Simulated Ecosystem Productivity: A Traceability Analysis in the East Asian Monsoon Region</title><author><first>Erqian</first><last>Cui</last></author><author><first>Kun</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>A.

At the middle to low latitudes, the East Asian monsoon region has higher productivity than forests in Europe‐Africa and North America, but its estimate by current generation of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) has seldom been systematically evaluated. Here, we developed a traceability framework to evaluate the simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) by 15 TBMs in the East Asian monsoon region. The framework links GPP to net primary productivity, biomass, leaf area and back to GPP via incorporating multiple vegetation functional properties of carbon‐use efficiency (CUE), vegetation C turnover time (τveg), leaf C fraction (Fleaf), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area index (LAI)‐level photosynthesis (PLAI), respectively. We then applied a relative importance algorithm to attribute intermodel variation at each node. The results showed that large intermodel variation in GPP over 1901–2010 were mainly propagated from their different representation of vegetation functional properties. For example, SLA explained 77% of the intermodel difference in leaf area, which contributed 90% to the simulated GPP differences. In addition, the models simulated higher CUE (18.1 ± 21.3%), τveg (18.2 ± 26.9%), and SLA (27.4±36.5%) than observations, leading to the overestimation of simulated GPP across the East Asian monsoon region. These results suggest the large uncertainty of current TBMs in simulating GPP is largely propagated from their poor representation of the vegetation functional properties and call for a better understanding of the covariations between plant functional properties in terrestrial ecosystems.</abstract><url hash="f058dd25">2019.GWF-1.49</url><doi>10.1029/2018GB005909</doi><bibkey>Cui-etal-2019-Vegetation</bibkey></paper><paper id="50"><title>Atmospheric Rivers Increase Future Flood Risk in Western Canada's Largest Pacific River</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Curry</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Islam</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Déry</last></author><abstract>Snow‐dominated watersheds are bellwethers of climate change.

Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model‐based estimates of river discharge.</abstract><url hash="e7986456">2019.GWF-1.51</url><doi>10.1029/2019GL083342</doi><bibkey>David-etal-2019-Analytical</bibkey></paper><paper id="52"><title>Wildfire severity reduces richness and alters composition of soil fungal communities in boreal forests of western Canada</title><author><first>N.</first><last>J.

Soil fungal communities are important for plant growth and nutrient cycling postfire but there is little understanding of how fires impact fungal communities across landscapes, fire severity gradients, and stand types in boreal forests. Understanding relationships between fungal community composition, particularly mycorrhizas, and understory plant composition is therefore important in predicting how future fire regimes may affect vegetation. We used an extreme wildfire event in boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories to test drivers of fungal communities and assess relationships with plant communities. We sampled soils from 39 plots 1 year after fire and 8 unburned plots. High‐throughput sequencing (MiSeq, ITS) revealed 2,034 fungal operational taxonomic units. We found soil pH and fire severity (proportion soil organic layer combusted), and interactions between these drivers were important for fungal community structure (composition, richness, diversity, functional groups). Where fire severity was low, samples with low pH had higher total fungal, mycorrhizal, and saprotroph richness compared to where severity was high. Increased fire severity caused declines in richness of total fungi, mycorrhizas, and saprotrophs, and declines in diversity of total fungi and mycorrhizas. The importance of stand age (a surrogate for fire return interval) for fungal composition suggests we could detect long‐term successional patterns even after fire. Mycorrhizal and plant community composition, richness, and diversity were weakly but significantly correlated. These weak relationships and the distribution of fungi across plots suggest that the underlying driver of fungal community structure is pH, which is modified by fire severity. This study shows the importance of edaphic factors in determining fungal community structure at large scales, but suggests these patterns are mediated by interactions between fire and forest stand composition.</abstract><url hash="7e9135ec">2019.GWF-1.52</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14641</doi><bibkey>J.

Achieving these goals will rely on the contribution of all nations and require balancing trade-offs among different sectors. Water and food insecurity have long been the two major challenges facing China. To address these challenges and achieve the SDGs, China needs to safeguard its agricultural irrigation and water conservancy projects. Although China is making efforts to transition its agricultural development to a sustainable trajectory by promoting water-saving irrigation, a number of issues are emerging, both with policy reforms and technological innovations. Through synthesizing the historical development of agriculture and its relationship with policy and political regimes, this paper identifies four major issues that are challenging the sustainability transformation of China’s agricultural irrigation system and water conservancy projects: (1) problems with financial policy coordination between central and local governments; (2) the lack of incentives for farmers to construct and maintain irrigation infrastructure; (3) conflicts between decentralized operation of land and benefits from shared irrigation infrastructure; and (4) deterioration of small-scale irrigation infrastructure calls for action. In addressing these challenges, policy changes are required: government financial accountability at all levels needs to be clarified; subsidies need to be raised for the construction and management of small-scale irrigation and water conservancy projects; local non-profit organizations need to be established to enhance co-management between farmers and government.</abstract><url hash="e0f5a04f">2019.GWF-1.55</url><doi>10.3390/su11247027</doi><bibkey>Du-etal-2019-China’s</bibkey></paper><paper id="56"><title>Advancement in Bedfast Lake ICE Mapping From Sentinel-1 Sar Data</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Duguay</last></author><author><first>Junqian</first><last>Wang</last></author><abstract>Algorithms for the generation of a bedfast/floating lake ice product from Sentinel-1A/B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were implemented, cross-compared, and validated for various permafrost regions (Alaska, Canada and Russia).

To characterize the phytotoxic effects and define a concentration threshold for H2O2, three microgreen species [arugula (Brassica eruca ssp. sativa), radish (Raphanus sativus), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus ‘Black Oil’)], and three lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cultivars, Othilie, Xandra, and Rouxai, were foliar sprayed once daily with water containing 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, or 200 mg·L−1 of H2O2 from seed to harvest under greenhouse conditions. Leaf damage was assessed at harvest using two distinct methods: 1) the percentage of damaged leaves per tray and 2) a damage index (DI). Applied H2O2 concentrations, starting from 25 mg·L−1, increased the percentage of damaged leaves in every species except ‘Black Oil’ sunflower, which remained unaffected by any applied concentration. Symptoms of leaf damage manifested in similar patterns on the surface of microgreen cotyledons and lettuce leaves, while mean DI values and extent of damage were unique to each crop. Fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area of all crops were not significantly affected by daily H2O2 spray. Identifying how foliar H2O2 damage manifests throughout the crop, as well at individual cotyledon or leaf surfaces, is necessary to establish an upper concentration threshold for H2O2 use. On the basis of the aforementioned metrics, maximum recommended concentrations were 150 mg·L−1 (radish), 100 mg·L−1 (arugula) for microgreens and 125 mg·L−1 (‘Othilie’), 75 mg·L−1 (‘Rouxai’), and 125 mg·L−1 (‘Xandra’) lettuce.</abstract><url hash="0efbc163">2019.GWF-1.57</url><doi>10.21273/HORTTECH04255-18</doi><bibkey>Eicher-Sodo-etal-2019-Characterizing</bibkey></paper><paper id="58"><title>Proximal remote sensing of tree physiology at northern treeline: Do late-season changes in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) respond to climate or photoperiod?</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Eitel</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Maguire</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Boelman</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Vierling</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Griffin</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Jensen</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Magney</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Mahoney</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Meddens</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Silva</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><abstract /><url hash="9e44dcf2">2019.GWF-1.58</url><doi>10.1016/J.RSE.2018.11.022</doi><bibkey>Eitel-etal-2019-Proximal</bibkey></paper><paper id="59"><title>Hillslope Hydrology in Global Change Research and Earth System Modeling</title><author><first>Ying</first><last>Fan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Swenson</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Band</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Brantley</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Brooks</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Dietrich</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Flores</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>W.

Here we bring together hydrologists, Critical Zone scientists, and ESM developers, to explore how hillslope structures may modulate ESM grid‐level water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes. In contrast to the one‐dimensional (1‐D), 2‐ to 3‐m deep, and free‐draining soil hydrology in most ESM land models, we hypothesize that 3‐D, lateral ridge‐to‐valley flow through shallow and deep paths and insolation contrasts between sunny and shady slopes are the top two globally quantifiable organizers of water and energy (and vegetation) within an ESM grid cell. We hypothesize that these two processes are likely to impact ESM predictions where (and when) water and/or energy are limiting. We further hypothesize that, if implemented in ESM land models, these processes will increase simulated continental water storage and residence time, buffering terrestrial ecosystems against seasonal and interannual droughts. We explore efficient ways to capture these mechanisms in ESMs and identify critical knowledge gaps preventing us from scaling up hillslope to global processes. One such gap is our extremely limited knowledge of the subsurface, where water is stored (supporting vegetation) and released to stream baseflow (supporting aquatic ecosystems). We conclude with a set of organizing hypotheses and a call for global syntheses activities and model experiments to assess the impact of hillslope hydrology on global change predictions.</abstract><url hash="e943ec64">2019.GWF-1.59</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR023903</doi><bibkey>Fan-etal-2019-Hillslope</bibkey></paper><paper id="60"><title>Risk Perception and Human Health Risk in Rural Communities Consuming Unregulated Well Water in Saskatchewan, Canada</title><author><first>Lorelei</first><last>Ford</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Waldner</last></author><author><first>Javier</first><last>Sánchez</last></author><author><first>Lalita</first><last>Bharadwaj</last></author><abstract>Rural communities dependent on unregulated drinking water are potentially at increased health risk from exposure to contaminants. Perception of drinking water safety influences water consumption, exposure, and health risk. A community‐based participatory approach and probabilistic Bayesian methods were applied to integrate risk perception in a holistic human health risk assessment. Tap water arsenic concentrations and risk perception data were collected from two Saskatchewan communities. Drinking water health standards were exceeded in 67% (51/76) of households in Rural Municipality #184 (RM184) and 56% (25/45) in Beardy's and Okemasis First Nation (BOFN). There was no association between the presence of a health exceedance and risk perception. Households in RM184 or with an annual income &gt;$50,000 were most likely to have in‐house water treatment. The probability of consuming tap water perceived as safe (92%) or not safe (0%) suggested that households in RM184 were unlikely to drink water perceived as not safe. The probability of drinking tap water perceived as safe (77%) or as not safe (11%) suggested households in BOFN contradicted their perception and consumed water perceived as unsafe. Integration of risk perception lowered the adult incremental lifetime cancer risk by 3% to 1.3 × 10−5 (95% CI 8.4 × 10−8 to 9.0 × 10−5) for RM184 and by 8.9 × 10−6 (95% CI 2.2 × 10−7 to 5.9 × 10−5) for BOFN.

Crevasses have the potential to bias geodetic measurements of elevation and mass change unless they are properly accounted for. We developed a framework that automatically maps and extracts crevasse geometry and masks them where they interfere with surface mass-balance assessment. Our study examines airborne light detection and ranging digital elevation models (LiDAR DEMs) from Haig Glacier, which is experiencing a transient response in its crevassed upper regions as the glacier thins, using a self-organizing map algorithm. This method successfully extracts and characterizes ~1000 crevasses, with an overall accuracy of 94%. The resulting map provides insight into stress and flow conditions. The crevasse mask also enables refined geodetic estimates of summer mass balance. From differencing of September and April LiDAR DEMs, the raw LiDAR DEM gives a 9% overestimate in the magnitude of glacier thinning over the summer: −5.48 m compared with a mean elevation change of −5.02 m when crevasses are masked out. Without identification and removal of crevasses, the LiDAR-derived summer mass balance therefore has a negative bias relative to the glaciological surface mass balance.</abstract><url hash="ccb53795">2019.GWF-1.61</url><doi>10.1017/jog.2019.71</doi><bibkey>Foroutan-etal-2019-Automatic</bibkey></paper><paper id="62"><title>Improving the Representation of Subsurface Water Movement in Land Models</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Gharari</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>Jefferson</first><last>S.

Water fluxes and stores regulate the Earth's climate and are essential for thriving aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as water, food, and energy security. But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional‐scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification. In sum, this paper presents an ambitious scientific and policy grand challenge that could substantially improve our understanding of the role of water in the Earth system and cross‐scale management of water cycle modifications that would be a complementary approach to existing water management tools.</abstract><url hash="22bb56b9">2019.GWF-1.63</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR024957</doi><bibkey>Gleeson-etal-2019-Illuminating</bibkey></paper><paper id="64"><title>Differences in preferential flow with antecedent moisture conditions and soil texture: Implications for subsurface P transport</title><author><first>Kirsten</first><last>N.

However, if and to what extent this may vary with soil texture, moisture conditions, and P placement is poorly understood. This study investigated (a) interactions between soil texture, antecedent moisture conditions, and the relative contributions of matrix and preferential flow and (b) associated P distributions through the soil profile when fertilizers were applied to the surface or subsurface. Brilliant blue dye was used to stain subsurface flowpaths in clay and silt loam plots during simulated rainfall events under wet and dry conditions. Fertilizer P was applied to the surface or via subsurface placement to plots of different soil texture and moisture condition. Photographs of dye stains were analysed to classify the flow patterns as matrix dominated or macropore dominated, and soils within plots were analysed for their water‐extractable P (WEP) content. Preferential flow occurred under all soil texture and moisture conditions. Dye penetrated deeper into clay soils via macropores and had lower interaction with the soil matrix, compared with silt loam soil. Moisture conditions influenced preferential flowpaths in clay, with dry clay having deeper infiltration (92 ± 7.6 cm) and less dye–matrix interaction than wet clay (77 ± 4.7 cm). Depth of staining did not differ between wet (56 ± 7.2 cm) and dry (50 ± 6.6 cm) silt loam, nor did dominant flowpaths. WEP distribution in the top 10 cm of the soil profile differed with fertilizer placement, but no differences in soil WEP were observed at depth. These results demonstrate that large rainfall events following drought conditions in clay soil may be prone to rapid P transport to tile drains due to increased preferential flow, whereas flow in silt loams is less affected by antecedent moisture. Subsurface placement of fertilizer may minimize the risk of subsurface P transport, particularily in clay.</abstract><url hash="bcdfc31a">2019.GWF-1.64</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13454</doi><bibkey>N.

A distinguishing feature of BACOLI is its ability to estimate and control error and correspondingly adapt meshes in both space and time. Many models of scientific interest, however, can be formulated as multiscale parabolic PDE systems, that is, models that couple a system of parabolic PDEs describing dynamics on a global scale with a system of ordinary differential equations describing dynamics on a local scale. This article describes the Fortran software eBACOLI, the extension of BACOLI to solve such multiscale models. The performance of the extended software is demonstrated to be statistically equivalent to the original for purely parabolic PDE systems. Results from eBACOLI are given for various multiscale models from the extended problem class considered.</abstract><url hash="52d1a236">2019.GWF-1.66</url><doi>10.1145/3301320</doi><bibkey>R.

Due to known limitations of fire datasets, an analysis of changes in fire-regime characteristics could not be easily undertaken. This paper presents fire-regime trends nationally and within two zonation systems, the homogeneous fire-regime zones and ecozones, for two time periods, 1959–2015 and 1980–2015. Nationally, trends in both area burned and number of large fires (≥200 ha) have increased significantly since 1959, which might be due to increases in lightning-caused fires. Human-caused fires, in contrast, have shown a decline. Results suggest that large fires have been getting larger over the last 57 years and that the fire season has been starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later. At the regional level, trends in fire regimes are variable across the country, with fewer significant trends. Area burned, number of large fires, and lightning-caused fires are increasing in most of western Canada, whereas human-caused fires are either stable or declining throughout the country. Overall, Canadian forests appear to have been engaged in a trajectory towards more active fire regimes over the last half century.</abstract><url hash="4ca7576e">2019.GWF-1.72</url><doi>10.1139/CJFR-2018-0293</doi><bibkey>C.

Local-scale advection of energy from warm snow-free surfaces to cold
snow-covered surfaces is an important component of the energy balance during
snow-cover depletion. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to quantify in
one-dimensional snowmelt models. This paper proposes a simple sensible and
latent heat advection model for snowmelt situations that can be readily
coupled to one-dimensional energy balance snowmelt models. An existing
advection parameterization was coupled to a conceptual frozen soil
infiltration surface water retention model to estimate the areal average
sensible and latent heat advection contributions to snowmelt. The proposed
model compared well with observations of latent and sensible heat advection,
providing confidence in the process parameterizations and the assumptions
applied. Snow-covered area observations from unmanned aerial vehicle imagery
were used to update and evaluate the scaling properties of snow patch area
distribution and lengths. Model dynamics and snowmelt implications were
explored within an idealized modelling experiment, by coupling to a
one-dimensional energy balance snowmelt model. Dry, snow-free surfaces were
associated with advection of dry air that compensated for positive sensible
heat advection fluxes and so limited the net influence of advection on
snowmelt. Latent and sensible heat advection fluxes both contributed positive
fluxes to snow when snow-free surfaces were wet and enhanced net advection
contributions to snowmelt. The increased net advection fluxes from wet
surfaces typically develop towards the end of snowmelt and offset decreases
in the one-dimensional areal average melt energy that declines with
snow-covered area. The new model can be readily incorporated into existing
one-dimensional snowmelt hydrology and land surface scheme models and will
foster improvements in snowmelt understanding and predictions.

Harrington</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><abstract>Permafrost distribution in mountains is typically more heterogeneous relative to low‐relief environments due to greater variability in the factors controlling the ground thermal regime, such as topography, snow depth, and sediment grain size (e.g., coarse blocks). Measuring and understanding the geothermal variability in high mountains remains challenging due to logistical constraints. This study presents one of the first applications of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) in periglacial environments to measure ground surface temperatures in a mountain permafrost area at much higher spatial resolution than possible with conventional methods using discrete temperature sensors. DTS measures temperature along a fibre‐optic cable at high spatial resolution (i.e., ≤ 1 m). Its use can be limited by power supply and calibration requirements, although recent methodological developments have relaxed some of these restrictions. Spatially continuous DTS measurements at a studied rock glacier provided greater resolution of geothermal variability and facilitated the interpretation of bottom temperature of snowpack data to map patchy permafrost distribution. This research highlights the potential for DTS to be a useful tool for permafrost mapping, ground thermal regime interpretation, conceptual geothermal model development, and numerical model evaluation in areas of heterogeneous mountain permafrost.</abstract><url hash="a5c4f25b">2019.GWF-1.74</url><doi>10.1002/ppp.1997</doi><bibkey>S.

The biomass production efficiency (BPE), defined as the ratio of BP to photosynthesis, and its variation across and within vegetation types is poorly understood, which hinders our capacity to accurately estimate carbon turnover times and carbon sinks. Here, we present a new global estimation of BPE obtained by combining field measurements from 113 sites with 14 carbon cycle models. Our best estimate of global BPE is 0.41 ± 0.05, excluding cropland. The largest BPE is found in boreal forests (0.48 ± 0.06) and the lowest in tropical forests (0.40 ± 0.04). Carbon cycle models overestimate BPE, although models with carbon–nitrogen interactions tend to be more realistic. Using observation‐based estimates of global photosynthesis, we quantify the global BP of non‐cropland ecosystems of 41 ± 6 Pg C/year. This flux is less than net primary production as it does not contain carbon allocated to symbionts, used for exudates or volatile carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere. Our study reveals a positive bias of 24 ± 11% in the model‐estimated BP (10 of 14 models). When correcting models for this bias while leaving modeled carbon turnover times unchanged, we found that the global ecosystem carbon storage change during the last century is decreased by 67% (or 58 Pg C).</abstract><url hash="4bca9377">2019.GWF-1.76</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14816</doi><bibkey>He-etal-2019-Global</bibkey></paper><paper id="77"><title>Phosphorothioate DNA Mediated Sequence-Insensitive Etching and Ripening of Silver Nanoparticles</title><author><first>Shengqiang</first><last>Hu</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>J.

We observed that cytosine-rich DNA oligonucleotides can etch silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). In this work, we showed that phosphorothioate (PS)-modified DNA (PS-DNA) can etch AgNPs independently of DNA sequence, suggesting that the thio-modifications are playing the major role in etching. Compared to unmodified DNA (e.g., poly-cytosine DNA), the concentration of required PS DNA decreases sharply, and the reaction rate increases. Furthermore, etching by PS-DNA occurs quite independent of pH, which is also different from unmodified DNA. The PS-DNA mediated etching could also be controlled well by varying DNA length and conformation, and the number and location of PS modifications. With a higher activity of PS-DNA, the process of etching, ripening, and further etching was taken place sequentially. The etching ability is inhibited by forming duplex DNA and thus etching can be used to measure the concentration of complementary DNA.</abstract><url hash="3ccda3e1">2019.GWF-1.77</url><doi>10.3389/fchem.2019.00198</doi><bibkey>Hu-etal-2019-Phosphorothioate</bibkey></paper><paper id="78"><title>A Race Against Time: Modeling Time Lags in Watershed Response</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Ilampooranan</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>V.

Best management practices implemented to improve water quality have met with limited success. Such lack of success is increasingly attributed to legacy nutrient stores in the subsurface that may act as sources after reduction of external inputs. However, current water‐quality models lack a framework to capture these legacy effects. Here we have modified the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model to capture the effects of nitrogen (N) legacies on water quality under multiple land‐management scenarios. Our new SWAT‐LAG model includes (1) a modified carbon‐nitrogen cycling module to capture the dynamics of soil N accumulation, and (2) a groundwater travel time distribution module to capture a range of subsurface travel times. Using a 502‐km2 Iowa watershed as a case study, we found that between 1950 and 2016, 25% of the total watershed N surplus (N Deposition + Fertilizer + Manure + N Fixation − Crop N uptake) had accumulated within the root zone, 14% had accumulated in groundwater, while 27% was lost as riverine output, and 34% was denitrified. In future scenarios, a 100% reduction in fertilizer application led to a 79% reduction in stream N load, but the SWAT‐LAG results suggest that it would take 84 years to achieve this reduction, in contrast to the 2 years predicted in the original SWAT model. The framework proposed here constitutes a first step toward modifying a widely used modeling approach to assess the effects of legacy N on the time required to achieve water‐quality goals.</abstract><url hash="ac72be70">2019.GWF-1.78</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR023815</doi><bibkey>Ilampooranan-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="79"><title>Postfire Soil Carbon Accumulation Does Not Recover Boreal Peatland Combustion Loss in Some Hydrogeological Settings</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Ingram</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Moore</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Wilkinson</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><abstract>Deep peat burning at the interface between subhumid Boreal Plains (BP) peatlands and forestlands (margin ecotones) in some hydrogeological settings has brought into question the long‐term stability of these peatlands under current and future predicted climate. Small peatlands located at midtopographic positions on coarse sediments have been identified as hot spots for severe burning, as these peatland margins are not regularly connected to regional groundwater flow. The ability of these peatland systems to recover carbon lost from both the interior and margin within the fire return interval, however, has not yet been investigated. Here we examine peatland soil carbon accumulation along a chronosequence of time since fire for 26 BP ombrotrophic bogs located across a range of hydrogeological settings. Soil organic carbon accumulation following wildfire does not appear to be influenced by hydrogeological setting; however, the ability of a peatland to recover the quantity of carbon lost within the fire return interval is dependent on the amount of carbon that was released through smoldering, which is influenced by hydrogeological setting for peatland margins. Based on published measurements of organic soil carbon loss during wildfire and our soil carbon accumulation rates, we suggest that peatlands located at topographic lows on coarse‐grained glaciofluvial outwash sediments or on low‐relief, fine‐grained sediment deposits from glaciolacustrine or subglacial paleoenvironments are currently resilient to wildfire on the BP landscape. Peatlands that experience severe smoldering at the margins, such as ephemerally perched systems on glaciofluvial outwash sediments, will likely undergo permanent loss of legacy carbon stores.</abstract><url hash="db758ee6">2019.GWF-1.79</url><doi>10.1029/2018JG004716</doi><bibkey>Ingram-etal-2019-Postfire</bibkey></paper><paper id="80"><title>Seasonal nutrient export dynamics in a mixed land use subwatershed of the Grand River, Ontario, Canada</title><author><first>Cameron</first><last>Irvine</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Morison</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><abstract /><url hash="25312a8d">2019.GWF-1.80</url><doi>10.1016/j.jglr.2019.10.005</doi><bibkey>Irvine-etal-2019-Seasonal</bibkey></paper><paper id="81"><title>Comparing Bug Replication in Regular and Micro Code Clones</title><author><first>Judith</first><last>F.

Clone fragments with a minimum size of 5 LOC were usually considered in previous studies. In recent studies, clone fragments which are less than 5 LOC are referred as micro-clones. It has been established by the literature that code clones are closely related with software bugs as well as bug replication. None of the previous studies have been conducted on bug-replication of micro-clones. In this paper we investigate and compare bug-replication in between regular and micro-clones. For the purpose of our investigation, we analyze the evolutionary history of our subject systems and identify occurrences of similarity preserving co-changes (SPCOs) in both regular and micro-clones where they experienced bug-fixes. From our experiment on thousands of revisions of six diverse subject systems written in three different programming languages, C, C# and Java we find that the percentage of clone fragments that take part in bug-replication is often higher in micro-clones than in regular code clones. The percentage of bugs that get replicated in micro-clones is almost the same as the percentage in regular clones. Finally, both regular and micro-clones have similar tendencies of replicating severe bugs according to our experiment. Thus, micro-clones in a code-base should not be ignored. We should rather consider these equally important as of the regular clones when making clone management decisions.</abstract><url hash="52361a1b">2019.GWF-1.81</url><doi>10.1109/ICPC.2019.00022</doi><bibkey>F.

In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude,
nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flow
regime to a nival–pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reduced
magnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on
factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of
maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime
influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the
Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed
extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a
process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically
downscaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the
average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large
increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak
flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations.
Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver
in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff
changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin
increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than
doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for
operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the
basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s
to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt
pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the
anticipated transition from a nival to a nival–pluvial hydrologic regime,
the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more
frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5
models, providing insights for other maritime-influenced extratropical
basins.

Using these procedures, spectral reflectance was successfully captured using an RPAS.</abstract><url hash="555bde02">2019.GWF-1.85</url><doi>10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900128</doi><bibkey>Kang-etal-2019-Operating</bibkey></paper><paper id="86"><title>Bi-directional hydrological changes in perched basins of the Athabasca Delta (Canada) in recent decades caused by natural processes</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Kay</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Wiklund</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Remmer</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Neary</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Brown</last></author><author><first>Aniruddha</first><last>Ghosh</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>MacDonald</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Thomson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Vucic</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Wesenberg</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hall</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><abstract>[1] Previous studies of river hydrometric records and Indigenous Knowledge holders claim that flood-induced recharge of ecologically important perched basins decreased across the Peace-Athabasca Delta after 1968 due mainly to hydroelectric regulation of Peace River flow. Natural deltaic processes and climate are acknowledged as additional, lesser contributors, but are challenging to evaluate. We use sediment records spanning ∼115 years from nine perched basins across the Athabasca Delta to test if unidirectional drying coincides with river regulation. Results show bi-directional hydrological changes since the early 1980s, not 1968, to reduced flooding in areas east of the Embarras River confluence with Cree/Mamawi creeks and increased flooding northward along the Cree/Mamawi distributary. The timing and pattern pinpoint the 1982 Embarras Breakthrough, a natural avulsion that diverted flow northward and away from the Athabasca Delta terminus, as the principal cause. The results demonstrate the need to factor natural deltaic processes into impending decisions on the delta’s UNESCO World Heritage status and implementation of a federal Action Plan to mitigate widespread drying.</abstract><url hash="cc528fb8">2019.GWF-1.86</url><doi>10.1088/2515-7620/ab37e7</doi><bibkey>Kay-etal-2019-Bi-directional</bibkey></paper><paper id="87"><title>Successful forecasting of harmful cyanobacteria blooms with high frequency lake data</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Kehoe</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Ingalls</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><abstract>Cyanobacterial blooms are causing increasing issues across the globe. Bloom forecasting can facilitate adaptation to blooms. Most bloom forecasting models depend on weekly or fortnightly sampling, but these sparse measurements can miss important dynamics. Here we develop forecasting models from five years of high frequency summer monitoring in a shallow lake (which serves as an important regional water supply). A suite of models were calibrated to predict cyanobacterial fluorescence (a biomass proxy) using measurements of: cyanobacterial fluorescence, water temperature, light, and wind speed. High temporal autocorrelation contributed to relatively strong predictive power over 1, 4 and 7 day intervals. Higher order derivatives of water temperature helped improve forecasting accuracy. While traditional monitoring and modelling have supported forecasting on longer timescales, we show high frequency monitoring combined with telemetry allows forecasting over timescales of 1 day to 1

Weather and climate are major factors influencing worldwide wildfire activity. This study assesses surface and atmospheric conditions associated with the 2014 extreme wildfires in the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. Hot and dry conditions led to the NWT experiencing the most severe wildfire season in its recorded history. The season included a record number of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and set a record for area burned. Lightning was the dominant ignition source and accounted for about 95% of the wildfires. Prolonged periods of smoke led to dramatic reductions in visibility, frequent road closures, and reduced air quality resulting in numerous health alerts. Temporal and spatial patterns of lightning characteristics in 2014, derived from Canadian Lightning Detection Network data, were different from those in other years with, for example, far more positive flashes from 0600 to 1200 utc (midnight to 6:00 am local time). The highest fraction of positive cloud-to-ground flashes (43.1%) occurred in the smoke-dominated North Slave region, which was more than in the Dehcho, South Slave, or Sahtu regions. Mid-tropospheric atmospheric circulation over a large region that included the NWT was classified into the six most common summer patterns. Results showed that ridging and ridge displacements occurred more frequently during 2014 although lightning was associated with all circulation patterns. This study has advanced the understanding of the roles of weather, lightning, and mid-tropospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme wildfires in northwestern Canada.</abstract><url hash="3c2a1bcc">2019.GWF-1.90</url><doi>10.1080/07055900.2019.1576023</doi><bibkey>Kochtubajda-etal-2019-An</bibkey></paper><paper id="91"><title>Contribution of Overland and Tile Flow to Runoff and Nutrient Losses from Vertisols in Manitoba, Canada.</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Kokulan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ali</last></author><abstract>This study quantified the contributions of overland and tile flow to total runoff (sum of overland and tile flow) and nutrient losses in a Vertisolic soil in the Red River valley (Manitoba, Canada), a region with a cold climate where tile drainage is rapidly expanding. Most annual runoff occurred as overland flow (72-89%), during spring snowmelt and large spring and summer storms. Tile drains did not flow in early spring due to frozen ground. Although tiles flowed in late spring and summer (33-100% of event flow), this represented a small volume of annual runoff (10-25%), which is in stark contrast with what has been observed in other tile-drained landscapes. Median daily flow-weighted mean concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP) and total P (TP) were significantly greater in overland flow than in tile flow ( &lt; 0.001), but the reverse pattern was observed for NO-N ( &lt; 0.001). Overland flow was the primary export pathway for both P and NO-N, accounting for &gt;95% of annual SRP and TP and 50 to 60% of annual NO-N losses. Data suggest that tile drains do not exacerbate P export from Vertisols in the Red River valley because they are decoupled from the surface by soil-ice during snowmelt, which is the primary time for P loss. However, NO-N loading to downstream water bodies may be exacerbated by tiles, particularly during spring and summer storms after fertilizer application.</abstract><url hash="4b2d2b5a">2019.GWF-1.91</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.03.0103</doi><bibkey>Kokulan-etal-2019-Contribution</bibkey></paper><paper id="92"><title>Impact of Future Climate and Vegetation on the Hydrology of an Arctic Headwater Basin at the Tundra–Taiga Transition</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Krogh</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>
 The rapidly warming Arctic is experiencing permafrost degradation and shrub expansion. Future climate projections show a clear increase in mean annual temperature and increasing precipitation in the Arctic; however, the impact of these changes on hydrological cycling in Arctic headwater basins is poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of climate change, as represented by simulations using a high-resolution atmospheric model under a pseudo-global-warming configuration, and projected changes in vegetation, using a spatially distributed and physically based Arctic hydrological model, on a small headwater basin at the tundra–taiga transition in northwestern Canada. Climate projections under the RCP8.5 emission scenario show a 6.1°C warming, a 38% increase in annual precipitation, and a 19 W m−2 increase in all-wave annual irradiance over the twenty-first century. Hydrological modeling results suggest a shift in hydrological processes with maximum peak snow accumulation increasing by 70%, snow-cover duration shortening by 26 days, active layer deepening by 0.25 m, evapotranspiration increasing by 18%, and sublimation decreasing by 9%. This results in an intensification of the hydrological regime by doubling discharge volume, a 130% increase in spring runoff, and earlier and larger peak streamflow. Most hydrological changes were found to be driven by climate change; however, increasing vegetation cover and density reduced blowing snow redistribution and sublimation, and increased evaporation from intercepted rainfall. This study provides the first detailed investigation of projected changes in climate and vegetation on the hydrology of an Arctic headwater basin, and so it is expected to help inform larger-scale climate impact studies in the Arctic.</abstract><url hash="d2247ae0">2019.GWF-1.92</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-18-0187.1</doi><bibkey>Krogh-etal-2019-Impact</bibkey></paper><paper id="93"><title>Lability classification of soil organic matter in the northern permafrost region</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Kuhry</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Barta</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Blok</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Elberling</last></author><author><first>Samuel</first><last>Faucherre</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Hugelius</last></author><author><first>Andreas</first><last>Richter</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Šantrůčková</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Weiss</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The large stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in soils
and deposits of the northern permafrost region are sensitive to global
warming and permafrost thawing. The potential release of this carbon (C) as
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere does not only depend on the total
quantity of soil organic matter (SOM) affected by warming and thawing, but it
also depends on its lability (i.e., the rate at which it will decay). In this study
we develop a simple and robust classification scheme of SOM lability for the
main types of soils and deposits in the northern permafrost region. The
classification is based on widely available soil geochemical parameters and
landscape unit classes, which makes it useful for upscaling to the entire
northern permafrost region. We have analyzed the relationship between C
content and C-CO2 production rates of soil samples in two different
types of laboratory incubation experiments. In one experiment, ca. 240 soil
samples from four study areas were incubated using the same protocol (at 5 ∘C, aerobically) over a period of 1 year. Here we present C
release rates measured on day 343 of incubation. These long-term results are
compared to those obtained from short-term incubations of ca. 1000 samples
(at 12 ∘C, aerobically) from an additional three study areas. In
these experiments, C-CO2 production rates were measured over the first
4 d of incubation. We have focused our analyses on the relationship
between C-CO2 production per gram dry weight per day (µgC-CO2 gdw−1 d−1) and C content (%C of dry weight) in the
samples, but we show that relationships are consistent when using C ∕ N ratios or
different production units such as µgC per gram soil C per day (µgC-CO2 gC−1 d−1) or per cm3 of soil per day
(µgC-CO2 cm−3 d−1). C content of the samples is
positively correlated to C-CO2 production rates but explains less than
50 % of the observed variability when the full datasets are considered. A
partitioning of the data into landscape units greatly reduces variance and
provides consistent results between incubation experiments. These results
indicate that relative SOM lability decreases in the order of Late Holocene
eolian deposits to alluvial deposits and mineral soils (including
peaty wetlands) to Pleistocene yedoma deposits to C-enriched pockets in cryoturbated soils to peat deposits. Thus,
three of the most important SOC storage classes in the northern permafrost
region (yedoma, cryoturbated soils and peatlands) show low relative SOM
lability. Previous research has suggested that SOM in these pools is
relatively undecomposed, and the reasons for the observed low rates of
decomposition in our experiments need urgent attention if we want to better
constrain the magnitude of the thawing permafrost carbon feedback on global
warming.

Here we propose elevating Citizen Social Science (CSS) to a new level across governments as an advanced collaborative approach of accelerating climate action and policies that moves beyond conventional citizen science and participatory approaches. Moving beyond the traditional science-policy model of the democratization of science in enabling more inclusive climate policy change, we present examples of how CSS can potentially transform citizen behavior and enable citizens to become key agents in driving climate policy change. We also discuss the barriers that could impede the implementation of CSS and offer solutions to these. In doing this, we articulate the implications of increased citizen action through CSS in moving forward the broader normative and political program of transdisciplinary and co-productive climate change research and policy.</abstract><url hash="3b47dfd5">2019.GWF-1.94</url><doi>10.3389/fenvs.2019.00010</doi><bibkey>Kythreotis-etal-2019-Citizen</bibkey></paper><paper id="95"><title>Extreme rainfall drives early onset cyanobacterial bloom</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Larsen</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Simon</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Sauvé</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><abstract>The increasing prevalence of cyanobacteria-dominated harmful algal blooms is strongly associated with nutrient loading and changing climatic patterns. Changes to precipitation frequency and intensity, as predicted by current climate models, are likely to affect bloom development and composition through changes in nutrient fluxes and water column mixing. However, few studies have directly documented the effects of extreme precipitation events on cyanobacterial composition, biomass, and toxin production. We tracked changes in a eutrophic reservoir following an extreme precipitation event, describing an atypically early toxin-producing cyanobacterial bloom, successional progression of the phytoplankton community, toxins, and geochemistry. An increase in bioavailable phosphorus by more than 27-fold in surface waters preceded notable increases in Aphanizomenon flos-aquae throughout the reservoir approximately 2 weeks post flood and ~5 weeks before blooms typically occur. Anabaenopeptin-A and three microcystin congeners (microcystin-LR, -YR, and -RR) were detected at varying levels across sites during the bloom period, which lasted between 3 and 5 weeks. Synthesis and applications: These findings suggest extreme rainfall can trigger early cyanobacterial bloom initiation, effectively elongating the bloom season period of potential toxicity. However, effects will vary depending on factors including the timing of rainfall and reservoir physical structure. In contrast to the effects of early season extreme rainfall, a mid-summer runoff event appeared to help mitigate the bloom in some areas of the reservoir by increasing flushing.</abstract><url hash="4c40ef43">2019.GWF-1.95</url><doi>10.1101/570275</doi><bibkey>Larsen-etal-2019-Extreme</bibkey></paper><paper id="96"><title>The Community Land Model Version 5: Description of New Features, Benchmarking, and Impact of Forcing Uncertainty</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Fisher</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Koven</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Oleson</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Swenson</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Bonan</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Collier</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Ghimire</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Kampenhout</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Kennedy</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Kluzek</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><author><first>Fang</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Hongyi</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lombardozzi</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Riley</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Sacks</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Shi</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Vertenstein</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Wieder</last></author><author><first>Chonggang</first><last>Xu</last></author><author><first>Ashehad</first><last>A.

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time‐evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5.</abstract><url hash="d549bef9">2019.GWF-1.96</url><doi>10.1029/2018MS001583</doi><bibkey>Lawrence-etal-2019-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="97"><title>The potential to reduce uncertainty in regional runoff projections from climate models</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Lehner</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Wood</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Vano</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Mankin</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a24e8e6f">2019.GWF-1.97</url><doi>10.1038/s41558-019-0639-x</doi><bibkey>Lehner-etal-2019-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="98"><title>Simulation of Capillary Pressure Overshoot in Snow Combining Trapping of the Wetting Phase With a Nonequilibrium Richards Equation Model</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Leroux</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>The timing and magnitude of snowmelt discharge and subsequent runoff are controlled by both matrix and preferential flows of water through snowpacks. Matrix flow can be estimated using the Richards equation, and recently, preferential flow in snowpacks has been represented in 2D and 3D models. A challenge for representing preferential flow through porous media in 2D or 3D is capillary pressure overshoot in 1D. Soil studies have developed sophisticated and largely realistic approaches to represent capillary pressure overshoot, but it has not been addressed in snowpack water flow models. Here a 1D nonequilibrium Richards equation model is implemented with dynamic capillary pressure and is combined with a new concept of entrapment of liquid water within the pore space. This new model well represented capillary pressure overshoot, as estimated by published capillary pressure measurements in snow samples of various grain sizes under different rates of liquid water infiltration. Three model parameters were calibrated, and their impacts on model outputs were evaluated. This improvement is a substantial step toward better understanding and simulating physical processes occurring while liquid water percolates an initially dry snowpack.</abstract><url hash="32f193fe">2019.GWF-1.98</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR022969</doi><bibkey>Leroux-etal-2019-Simulation</bibkey></paper><paper id="99"><title>Larger Increases in More Extreme Local Precipitation Events as Climate Warms</title><author><first>Chao</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Gang</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Jian</first><last>Lu</last></author><author><first>Guilong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Norris</last></author><author><first>Yaheng</first><last>Tan</last></author><author><first>Ying</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Min</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>Climate models project that extreme precipitation events will intensify in proportion to their intensity during the 21st century at large spatial scales. The identification of the causes of this phenomenon nevertheless remains tenuous. Using a large ensemble of North American regional climate simulations, we show that the more rapid intensification of more extreme events also appears as a robust feature at finer regional scales. The larger increases in more extreme events than in less extreme events are found to be primarily due to atmospheric circulation changes. Thermodynamically induced changes have relatively uniform effects across extreme events and regions. In contrast, circulation changes weaken moderate events over western interior regions of North America and enhance them elsewhere. The weakening effect decreases and even reverses for more extreme events, whereas there is further intensification over other parts of North America, creating an “intense gets intenser” pattern over most of the continent.</abstract><url hash="45f6a368">2019.GWF-1.99</url><doi>10.1029/2019GL082908</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2019-Larger</bibkey></paper><paper id="100"><title>Sedimentary DNA reveals over 150 years of ecosystem change by human activities in Lake Chao, China.</title><author><first>Feilong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Xiaowei</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>Jizhong</first><last>Wang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="68262a19">2019.GWF-1.100</url><doi>10.1016/j.envint.2019.105214</doi><bibkey>Li-etal-2019-Sedimentary</bibkey></paper><paper id="101"><title>Intercomparison of Multiple Hydroclimatic Datasets across the Lower Nelson River Basin, Manitoba, Canada</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Lilhare</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Déry</last></author><author><first>Scott</first><last>Pokorny</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Stadnyk</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Koenig</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT This study evaluates the 1981–2010 spatiotemporal differences in six available climate datasets (daily total precipitation and mean air temperature) over the Lower Nelson River Basin (LNRB) in ten of its sub-watersheds at seasonal and annual time scales. We find that the Australian National University spline interpolation (ANUSPLIN), and inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolated observations from 14 Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) meteorological stations show dry biases, whereas reanalysis products tend to overestimate precipitation across most of the basin. All datasets exhibit prominent disagreement in precipitation trends whereby the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and European Union Water and Global Change (WATCH) Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI) show exceptional wetting trends, while the IDW and ANUSPLIN data manifest drying trends. Mean air temperature trends generally agree across most of the datasets; however, the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and IDW show stronger warming relative to other datasets. Overall, analyses of the different climate datasets and their ensemble reveal that the choice of input dataset plays a crucial role in the accurate estimation of historical climatic conditions, particularly when assessing trends, for the LNRB. Using the ensemble has the distinct advantage of preserving the unique strengths of all datasets and affords the opportunity to estimate the uncertainty for hydrologic modelling and climate change impact studies.</abstract><url hash="1f211a8f">2019.GWF-1.101</url><doi>10.1080/07055900.2019.1638226</doi><bibkey>Lilhare-etal-2019-Intercomparison</bibkey></paper><paper id="102"><title>Radar Scatter Decomposition to Differentiate between Running Ice Accumulations and Intact Ice Covers along Rivers</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>Zhaoqin</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>For ice-jam flood forecasting it is important to differentiate between intact ice covers and ice runs. Ice runs consist of long accumulations of rubble ice that stem from broken up ice covers or ice-jams that have released. A water wave generally travels ahead of the ice run at a faster celerity, arriving at the potentially high flood–risk area much sooner than the ice accumulation. Hence, a rapid detection of the ice run is necessary to lengthen response times for flood mitigation. Intact ice covers are stationary and hence are not an immediate threat to a downstream flood situation, allowing more time for flood preparedness. However, once ice accumulations are moving and potentially pose imminent impacts to flooding, flood response may have to switch from a mitigation to an evacuation mode of the flood management plan. Ice runs are generally observed, often by chance, through ground observations or airborne surveys. In this technical note, we introduce a novel method of differentiating ice runs from intact ice covers using imagery acquired from space-borne radar backscatter signals. The signals are decomposed into different scatter components—surface scattering, volume scattering and double-bounce—the ratios of one to another allow differentiation between intact and running ice. The method is demonstrated for the breakup season of spring 2018 along the Athabasca River, when an ice run shoved into an intact ice cover which led to some flooding in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.</abstract><url hash="86284b35">2019.GWF-1.102</url><doi>10.3390/rs11030307</doi><bibkey>Lindenschmidt-etal-2019-Radar</bibkey></paper><paper id="103"><title>A Stochastic Hydraulic Modelling Approach to Determining the Probable Maximum Staging of Ice-Jam Floods</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><abstract>There is a need to determine the maximum backwater staging possible from ice jam flooding along high flood risk prone sections of northern rivers. Similar to the probable maximum flood PMF, which is primarily estimated for the most extreme open-water floods, probable maximum floods from ice jamming PMFice can provide upper thresholds of water level elevations so essential for infrastructure designed in and along cold-region rivers. However, the processes for maximum ice-jam flooding are quite different from those of extreme open-water floods which requires river ice processes to be incorporated into the calculation approach. This paper presents a novel method for estimating the probable maximum staging from ice-jam floods. The method is based on the implementation of a deterministic hydraulic model that mimics ice jam processes and is nested in a stochastic framework to carry out Monte-Carlo simulations to randomise parameter and boundary condition value inputs for many hundreds of simulations. This stochastic approach provides the frequency distributions of many of the boundary conditions used to force the river ice hydraulic model. The stochastic modelling framework yields ensembles of backwater levels from which the maximum level provides an indication of the probable maximum staging possible, the PMFice.</abstract><url hash="f12f7ba3">2019.GWF-1.103</url><doi>10.3808/JEI.201900416</doi><bibkey>Lindenschmidt-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="104"><title>CE-QUAL-W2 model of dam outflow elevation impact on temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrients in a reservoir</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Carr</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Sadeghian</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><abstract /><url hash="6f4bee00">2019.GWF-1.104</url><doi>10.1038/s41597-019-0316-y</doi><bibkey>Lindenschmidt-etal-2019-CE-QUAL-W2</bibkey></paper><paper id="105"><title>Development of an Ice Jam Flood Forecasting System for the Lower Oder River—Requirements for Real-Time Predictions of Water, Ice and Sediment Transport</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Carstensen</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Fröhlich</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Hentschel</last></author><author><first>Stefan</first><last>Iwicki</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kögel</last></author><author><first>Michał</first><last>Kubicki</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Kundzewicz</last></author><author><first>Cornelia</first><last>Lauschke</last></author><author><first>Adam</first><last>Łazarów</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Łoś</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Marszelewski</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Niedzielski</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Nowak</last></author><author><first>Bogusław</first><last>Pawłowski</last></author><author><first>Michael</first><last>Roers</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schlaffer</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Weintrit</last></author><abstract>Despite ubiquitous warming, the lower Oder River typically freezes over almost every year. Ice jams may occur during freeze-up and ice cover breakup phases, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the river, with weirs and piers. The slush ice and ice blocks may accumulate to form ice jams, leading to backwater effects and substantial water level rise. The small bottom slope of the lower Oder and the tidal backflow from the Baltic Sea enhance the formation of ice jams during cold weather conditions, jeopardizing the dikes. Therefore, development of an ice jam flood forecasting system for the Oder River is much needed. This commentary presents selected results from an international workshop that took place in Wrocław (Poland) on 26–27 November 2018 that brought together an international team of experts to explore the requirements and research opportunities in the field of ice jam flood forecasting and risk assessment for the Oder River section along the German–Polish border. The workshop launched a platform for collaboration amongst Canadian, German and Polish scientists, government officials and water managers to pave a way forward for joint research focused on achieving the long-term goal of forecasting, assessing and mitigating ice jam impacts along the lower Oder. German and Polish government agencies are in need of new tools to forecast ice jams and assess their subsequent consequences and risks to communities and ship navigation along a river. Addressing these issues will also help research and ice flood management in a Canadian context. A research program would aim to develop a modelling system by addressing fundamental issues that impede the prediction of ice jam events and their consequences in cold regions.</abstract><url hash="184cde96">2019.GWF-1.105</url><doi>10.3390/W11010095</doi><bibkey>Lindenschmidt-etal-2019-Development</bibkey></paper><paper id="106"><title>A novel stochastic modelling approach for operational real-time ice-jam flood forecasting</title><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>Zhaoqin</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Richard</last></author><abstract /><url hash="81458f2c">2019.GWF-1.106</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2019.05.048</doi><bibkey>Lindenschmidt-etal-2019-A1</bibkey></paper><paper id="107"><title>Agricultural Water Quality in Cold Climates: Processes, Drivers, Management Options, and Research Needs.</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Bergström</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Glenn</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Vadas</last></author><abstract>Cold agricultural regions are important sites of global food production. This has contributed to widespread water quality degradation influenced by processes and hydrologic pathways that differ from warm region analogues. In cold regions, snowmelt is often a dominant period of nutrient loss. Freeze-thaw processes contribute to nutrient mobilization. Frozen ground can limit infiltration and interaction with soils, and minimal nutrient uptake during the nongrowing season may govern nutrient export from agricultural catchments. This paper reviews agronomic, biogeochemical, and hydrological characteristics of cold agricultural regions and synthesizes findings of 23 studies that are published in this special section, which provide new insights into nutrient cycling and hydrochemical processes, model developments, and the efficacy of different potentially beneficial management practices (BMPs) across varied cold regions. Growing evidence suggests the need to redefine optimum soil phosphorus levels and input regimes in cold regions to allow achievement of water quality targets while still supporting strong agricultural productivity. Practices should be considered through a regional and site-specific lens, due to potential interactions between climate, hydrology, vegetation, and soils, which influence the efficacy of nutrient, crop, water, and riparian buffer management. This leads to differing suitability of BMPs across varied cold agricultural regions. We propose a systematic approach (""), to achieve water quality objectives in variable and changing climates, which combines nutrient transport process onceptualization, nderstanding BMP functions, redicting effects of variability and change, onsideration of producer input and agronomic and environmental tradeoffs, practice daptation, nowledge mobilization, and valuation of water quality improvement.</abstract><url hash="f642bfba">2019.GWF-1.107</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.05.0220</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2019-Agricultural</bibkey></paper><paper id="108"><title>Impacts of Soil Phosphorus Drawdown on Snowmelt and Rainfall Runoff Water Quality.</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><abstract>Managing P export from agricultural land is critical to address freshwater eutrophication. However, soil P management, and options to draw down soil P have received little attention in snowmelt-dominated regions because of limited interaction between soil and snowmelt. Here, we assessed the impacts of soil P drawdown (reducing fertilizer P inputs combined with harvest removal) on soil Olsen P dynamics, runoff P concentrations, and crop yields from 1997 to 2014 in paired fields in Manitoba, Canada. We observed that Olsen P concentrations in the 0- to 5-cm soil layer were negatively correlated with the cumulative P depletion and declined rapidly at the onset of the drawdown practice (3.1 to 5.4 mg kg yr during 2007-2010). In both snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff, concentrations of total dissolved P (TDP) were positively correlated with the concentrations of soil Olsen P. Soil P drawdown to low to moderate fertility levels significantly decreased mean annual flow-weighted TDP concentrations in snowmelt runoff from 0.60 to 0.30 mg L in the field with high initial soil P and from 1.17 to 0.42 mg L in the field with very high initial soil P. Declines in TDP concentration in rainfall runoff were greater. Critically, yields of wheat ( spp.) and canola ( L.) were not affected by soil P depletion. In conclusion, we demonstrate that relatively rapid reductions in P loads are achievable at the field scale via managing P inputs and soil P pools, highlighting a management opportunity that can maintain food security while improving water security in cold regions.</abstract><url hash="66fda22b">2019.GWF-1.108</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.12.0437</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2019-Impacts</bibkey></paper><paper id="109"><title>Impacts of Cover Crops and Crop Residues on Phosphorus Losses in Cold Climates: A Review.</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kleinman</last></author><abstract>The use of cover crops and crop residues is a common strategy to mitigate sediment and nutrient losses from land to water. In cold climates, elevated dissolved P losses can occur associated with freeze-thaw of plant materials. Here, we review the impacts of cover crops and crop residues on dissolved P and total P loss in cold climates across ∼41 studies, exploring linkages between water-extractable P (WEP) in plant materials and P loss in surface runoff and subsurface drainage. Water-extractable P concentrations are influenced by plant type and freezing regimes. For example, WEP was greater in brassica cover crops than in non-brassicas, and increased with repeated freeze-thaw cycles. However, total P losses in surface runoff and subsurface drainage from cropped fields under cold climates were much lower than plant WEP, owing to retention of 45 to &gt;99% of released P by soil. In cold climatic regions, cover crops and crop residues generally prevented soil erosion and loss of particle-bound P during nongrowing seasons in erodible landscapes but tended to elevate dissolved P loss in nonerodible soils. Their impact on total P loss was inconsistent across studies and complicated by soil, climate, and management factors. More research is needed to understand interactions between these factors and plant type that influence P loss, and to improve the assessment of crop contributions to P loss in field settings in cold climates. Further, tradeoffs between P loss and the control of sediment loss and N leaching by plants should be acknowledged.</abstract><url hash="11fa92bd">2019.GWF-1.109</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.03.0119</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2019-Impacts1</bibkey></paper><paper id="110"><title>Field-experiment constraints on the enhancement of the terrestrial carbon sink by CO2 fertilization</title><author><first>Yongwen</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Piao</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Gasser</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Ciais</last></author><author><first>Hui</first><last>Yang</last></author><author><first>Han</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Keenan</last></author><author><first>Mengtian</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Wan</last></author><author><first>Jian</first><last>Song</last></author><author><first>Kai</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Janssens</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Peñuelas</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Huntingford</last></author><author><first>Xuhui</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Altaf Arain</last></author><author><first>Yuanyuan</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Fisher</last></author><author><first>Maoyi</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Huntzinger</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ito</last></author><author><first>Atul</first><last>K.

Here, we used complementary in situ measurements, model simulations, and satellite observations to investigate the net carbon dioxide (CO2) seasonal cycle and its climatic and environmental controls across Alaska and northwestern Canada during the anomalously warm winter to spring conditions of 2015 and 2016 (relative to 2010–2014). In the warm spring, we found that photosynthesis was enhanced more than respiration, leading to greater CO2 uptake. However, photosynthetic enhancement from spring warming was partially offset by greater ecosystem respiration during the preceding anomalously warm winter, resulting in nearly neutral effects on the annual net CO2 balance. Eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements showed that air temperature has a primary influence on net CO2 exchange in winter and spring, while soil moisture has a primary control on net CO2 exchange in the fall. The net CO2 exchange was generally more moisture limited in the boreal region than in the Arctic tundra. Our analysis indicates complex seasonal interactions of underlying C cycle processes in response to changing climate and hydrology that may not manifest in changes in net annual CO2 exchange. Therefore, a better understanding of the seasonal response of C cycle processes may provide important insights for predicting future carbon–climate feedbacks and their consequences on atmospheric CO2 dynamics in the northern high latitudes.</abstract><url hash="9f337a74">2019.GWF-1.112</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14863</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2019-Increased</bibkey></paper><paper id="113"><title>Monitoring Groundwater Change in California’s Central Valley Using Sentinel-1 and GRACE Observations</title><author><first>Zhen</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Pang-Wei</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Massoud</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Farr</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lundgren</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><abstract>The San Joaquin Valley and Tulare basins in California’s Central Valley have intensive agricultural activity and groundwater demand that has caused significant subsidence and depletion of water resources in the past. We measured groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in the southern Central Valley from March 2015 to May 2017 using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The InSAR measurements provided fine spatial details of subsidence patterns and displayed a superposition of secular and seasonal variations that were coherent across our study region and correlated with precipitation variability and changes in freshwater demand. Combining InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, precipitation, and in situ well records showed a broad scale slowdown/cessation of long term subsidence in the wetter winter of 2017, likely reflecting the collective response of the Central Valley aquifer system to heavier-than-usual precipitation. We observed a very good temporal correlation between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite groundwater anomaly (GWA) variation and long-term subsidence records, regardless of local hydrogeology and mechanical properties. This indicates the subsidence from satellite geodesy is a very useful indicator for tracking groundwater storage change. With the continuing acquisition of Sentinel-1 and other satellites, we anticipate decadal-scale subsidence records with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters will be available in the near future to be combined with basin-averaged GRACE measurements to improve our estimate of time-varying groundwater change.</abstract><url hash="e8344ae2">2019.GWF-1.113</url><doi>10.3390/geosciences9100436</doi><bibkey>Liu-etal-2019-Monitoring</bibkey></paper><paper id="114"><title>Do the societal benefits of river restoration outweigh their costs?

The U.S. National Weather Service's Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) provides snow products at high spatial (~1 km2) and temporal (daily) resolution for the contiguous United States and southern Canada. This study evaluated the SNODAS SWE product in the boreal forest, prairie, and Canadian Rockies of western Canada against extensive snow survey measurements. SNODAS was found to work well in sheltered environments, to overestimate SWE under needle‐leaf forests, and to be unable to capture the spatial variation of SWE in windswept prairie and alpine environments. Results indicate that SNODAS SWE accuracy is strongly influenced by the missing blowing snow redistribution and canopy energetics and snow interception and sublimation processes in the mass balance calculations of the SNODAS model and by erroneous precipitation data forcing the model. To demonstrate how errors caused by missing processes can be corrected in areas with low assimilation frequency, SNODAS data were assimilated into a physically based hydrological model created using the modular Cold Region Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform that includes blowing and intercepted snow redistribution and subcanopy melt energetic processes. This approach decreased the overestimation of SWE compared to SNODAS from 135 to 79% in the study area and suggests that snow assimilation modeled SWE quality can be improved if snow redistribution, sublimation, and subcanopy melt processes are incorporated.</abstract><url hash="ef598efb">2019.GWF-1.117</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025333</doi><bibkey>Lv-etal-2019-Evaluation</bibkey></paper><paper id="118"><title>Evaluating Hydrologic Response in Tile-Drained Landscapes: Implications for Phosphorus Transport.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ali</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>King</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Plach</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Pluer</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Morison</last></author><author><first>W.</first><last>Tang</last></author><abstract>Phosphorus (P) loss in agricultural discharge has typically been associated with surface runoff; however, tile drains have been identified as a key P pathway due to preferential transport. Identifying when and where these pathways are active may establish high-risk periods and regions that are vulnerable for P loss. A synthesis of high-frequency, runoff data from eight cropped fields across the Great Lakes region of North America over a 3-yr period showed that both surface and tile flow occurred year-round, although tile flow occurred more frequently. The relative timing of surface and tile flow activation was classified into four response types to infer runoff-generation processes. Response types were found to vary with season and soil texture. In most events across all sites, tile responses preceded surface flow, whereas the occurrence of surface flow prior to tile flow was uncommon. The simultaneous activation of pathways, indicating rapid connectivity through the vadose zone, was seldom observed at the loam sites but occurred at clay sites during spring and summer. Surface flow at the loam sites was often generated as saturation-excess, a phenomenon rarely observed on the clay sites. Contrary to expectations, significant differences in P loads in tiles were not apparent under the different response types. This may be due to the frequency of the water quality sampling or may indicate that factors other than surface-tile hydrologic connectivity drive tile P concentrations. This work provides new insight into spatial and temporal differences in runoff mechanisms in tile-drained landscapes.</abstract><url hash="7fe6936a">2019.GWF-1.118</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.02.0060</doi><bibkey>Macrae-etal-2019-Evaluating</bibkey></paper><paper id="119"><title>Optofluidic Dissolved Oxygen Sensing With Sensitivity Enhancement Through Multiple Reflections</title><author><first>Eric</first><last>Mahoney</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Hsu</last></author><author><first>Fei</first><last>Du</last></author><author><first>Bo</first><last>Xiong</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>Q.</first><last>Fang</last></author><abstract>The development of compact and low-cost dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors is essential for the continuous in situ monitoring of environmental water quality and wastewater treatment processes. The optical detection of dynamic and reversible quenching of fluorescent dyes by oxygen has been used for DO sensing. In this paper, we have optimized a multilayer optofluidic device based on the measurement of fluorescence quenching in a Ruthenium-based oxygen sensitive dye by employing total internal reflection (TIR) of the excitation light to achieve sensitivity enhancement for the detection of 0–20-ppm DO in water. The incident angles of light and sensitive layer thickness are optimized experimentally in order to increase the path length of light in the sensitive layer of the device through multiple reflections. A model is developed to demonstrate how light propagates through different layers of the device at varying angles of excitation and to describe the mechanism of fluorescence generation for each of the types of TIR observed. The design principles identified in this paper may be applied to the development and optimization of new multilayered optofluidic sensors by employing TIR for sensitivity enhancement.</abstract><url hash="08e1a3fc">2019.GWF-1.119</url><doi>10.1109/JSEN.2019.2932414</doi><bibkey>Mahoney-etal-2019-Optofluidic</bibkey></paper><paper id="120"><title>Introductory overview: Optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other metaheuristics</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Maier</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>Z.</first><last>Kapelan</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Matott</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Kasprzyk</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Tolson</last></author><abstract /><url hash="5a10489b">2019.GWF-1.120</url><doi>10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2018.11.018</doi><bibkey>Maier-etal-2019-Introductory</bibkey></paper><paper id="121"><title>Peripheral Notifications in Large Displays: Effects of Feature Combination and Task Interference</title><author><first>Aristides</first><last>Mairena</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Gutwin</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Cockburn</last></author><abstract>Visual notifications are integral to interactive computing systems. With large displays, however, much of the content is in the user's visual periphery, where human capacity to notice visual effects is diminished. One design strategy for enhancing noticeability is to combine visual features, such as motion and colour. Yet little is known about how feature combinations affect noticeability across the visual field, or about how peripheral noticeability changes when a user's primary task involves the same visual features as the notification. We addressed these questions by conducting two studies. Results of the first study showed that noticeability of feature combinations were approximately equal to the better of the individual features. Results of the second study suggest that there can be interference between the features of primary tasks and the visual features in the notifications. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how visual features operate when used as peripheral notifications.</abstract><url hash="2d17780d">2019.GWF-1.121</url><doi>10.1145/3290605.3300870</doi><bibkey>Mairena-etal-2019-Peripheral</bibkey></paper><paper id="122"><title>Spatial distribution of agricultural pesticide use and predicted wetland exposure in the Canadian Prairie Pothole Region.</title><author><first>Egina</first><last>Malaj</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Liber</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Morrissey</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b41e29b7">2019.GWF-1.122</url><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134765</doi><bibkey>Malaj-etal-2019-Spatial</bibkey></paper><paper id="123"><title>Antagonistic, synergistic and direct effects of land use and climate on Prairie wetland ecosystems: Ghosts of the past or present?</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Mantyka‐Pringle</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Leston</last></author><author><first>David</first><last>J.

The application of the MyLake‐Sediment model to boreal Lake Vansjø illustrates the model's ability to reproduce daily water quality variables and predict sediment‐water column exchange fluxes over a long historical period. In prognostic scenarios, we assessed the importance of sediment processes and the effects of various climatic and anthropogenic drivers on the lake's biogeochemistry and phytoplankton dynamics. First, MyLake‐Sediment was used to simulate the potential impacts of increasing air temperature on algal growth and water quality. Second, the key role of ice cover in controlling water column mixing and biogeochemical cycles was analyzed in a series of scenarios that included a fully ice‐free end‐member. Third, in another end‐member scenario P loading from the watershed to the lake was abruptly halted. The model results suggest that remobilization of legacy P stored in the bottom sediments could sustain the lake's primary productivity on a time scale of several centuries. Finally, while the majority of management practices to reduce excessive algal growth in lakes focus on reducing external P loads, other efforts rely on the addition of reactive materials that sequester P in the sediment. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of ferric iron additions in decreasing the dissolved phosphate efflux from the sediment and, consequently, limit phytoplankton growth in Lake Vansjø.</abstract><url hash="5d7d8c82">2019.GWF-1.124</url><doi>10.1029/2019JG005254</doi><bibkey>Markelov-etal-2019-Coupling</bibkey></paper><paper id="125"><title>Assessment of Water Cycle Intensification Over Land using a Multisource Global Gridded Precipitation DataSet</title><author><first>Y.</first><last>Markonis</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Martinkova</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hanel</last></author><abstract>The change in the empirical distribution of future global precipitation is one of the major implications regarding the intensification of global water cycle.

Wastewater-dominated environments are often riddled by a myriad of stressors, such as chemical and thermal stressors. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an environmentally relevant concentration of a commonly prescribed antidepressant, venlafaxine (VFX) [1.0 μg/L], in addition to a 5°C increase in water temperature on zebrafish metabolism. Fish were chronically exposed (21 days) to one of four conditions: (i) 0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (ii) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (iii) 0 μg/L VFX at 32°C; (iv) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 32°C. Following exposure, whole-body metabolism was assessed by routine metabolic rate (RMR) measurements, whereas tissue-specific metabolism was assessed by measuring the activities of major metabolic enzymes in addition to glucose levels in muscle. RMR was significantly higher in the multi-stressed group relative to Control. The combination of both stressors resulted in elevated pyruvate kinase activity and glucose levels, while lipid metabolism was depressed, as measured by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity. Citrate synthase activity increased with the onset of temperature, but only in the group treatment without VFX. Catalase activity was also elevated with the onset of the temperature stressor, however, that was not the case for the multi-stressed group, potentially indicating a deleterious effect of VFX on the anti-oxidant defense mechanism. The results of this study highlight the importance of multiple-stressor research, as it able to further bridge the gap between field and laboratory studies, as well as have the potential of yielding surprising results that may have not been predicted using a conventional single-stressor approach.</abstract><url hash="c474dd38">2019.GWF-1.127</url><doi>10.3389/fphys.2019.01431</doi><bibkey>Mehdi-etal-2019-Multiple</bibkey></paper><paper id="128"><title>Subjective modeling decisions can significantly impact the simulation of flood and drought events</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Melsen</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Teuling</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Torfs</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Zappa</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Mendoza</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Uijlenhoet</last></author><abstract /><url hash="54cbc0a9">2019.GWF-1.128</url><doi>10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2018.11.046</doi><bibkey>Melsen-etal-2019-Subjective</bibkey></paper><paper id="129"><title>Heterogeneous Changes in Western North American Glaciers Linked to Decadal Variability in Zonal Wind Strength</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hugonnet</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Shean</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Gardner</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Howat</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Berthier</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Pelto</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Tennant</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Shea</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Noh</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Brun</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Dehecq</last></author><abstract>Western North American (WNA) glaciers outside of Alaska cover 14,384 km2 of mountainous terrain.

Phillips</last></author><abstract>As more hydroelectric dams regulate rivers to meet growing energy demands, there is ongoing concern about downstream effects, including impacts on downstream benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities. Hydropeaking is a common hydroelectric practice where short‐term variation in power production leads to large and often rapid fluctuations in discharge and water level. There are key knowledge gaps on the ecosystem impacts of hydropeaking in large rivers, the seasonality of these impacts, and whether dams can be managed to lessen impacts. We assessed how patterns of hydropeaking affect abundance, taxonomic richness, and relative tolerance of BMIs in the Saskatchewan River (Saskatchewan, Canada). Reaches immediately (&lt;2 km) downstream of the dam generally had high densities of BMIs and comparable taxonomic diversity relative to upstream locations but were characterized by lower ratios of sensitive (e.g., Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) to tolerant (e.g., Chironomidae) taxa. The magnitude of effect varied with seasonal changes in discharge. Understanding the effects of river regulation on BMI biodiversity and river health has implications for mitigating the impacts of hydropeaking dams on downstream ecosystems. Although we demonstrated that a hydropeaking dam may contribute to a significantly different downstream BMI assemblage, we emphasize that seasonality is a key consideration. The greatest differences between upstream and downstream locations occurred in spring, suggesting standard methods of late summer and fall sampling may underestimate ecosystem‐scale impacts.</abstract><url hash="430b79da">2019.GWF-1.130</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3434</doi><bibkey>Mihalicz-etal-2019-Seasonal</bibkey></paper><paper id="131"><title>Application of a 1 km2 resolution model for climate change effects upon Benin and Nigeria vegetable agriculture</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Minielly</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Adebooye</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Akponikpè</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Oyedele</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Boer</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Peak</last></author><abstract>Climate change and food security are complex global issues that require multidisciplinary approaches to resolve. A nexus exists between both issues, especially in developing countries, but little prior research has successfully bridged the divide. Existing resolutions to climate change and food security are expensive and resource demanding. Climate modelling is at the forefront of climate change literature and development planning, whereas agronomy research is leading food security plans. The Benin Republic and Nigeria have grown and developed in recent years but may not have all the tools required to implement and sustain long-term food security in the face of climate change. The objective of this paper is to describe the development and outputs of a new model that bridges climate change and food security. Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 5th Regional Assessment (IPCC AR5) were combined with a biodiversity database to develop the model to derive these outputs. The model was used to demonstrate what potential impacts climate change will have on the regional food security by incorporating agronomic data from four local underutilized indigenous vegetables (Amaranthus cruentus L., Solanum macrocarpon L., Telfairia occidentalis Hook f., and Ocimum gratissimum L.). The model shows that, by 2099, there is significant uncertainty within the optimal recommendations that originated from the MicroVeg project. This suggests that MicroVeg will not have long-term success for food security unless additional options (e.g., new field trials, shifts in vegetable grown) are considered, creating the need for need for more dissemination tools.</abstract><url hash="340c494c">2019.GWF-1.131</url><doi>10.1139/geomat-2019-0014</doi><bibkey>Minielly-etal-2019-Application</bibkey></paper><paper id="132"><title>On the choice of calibration metrics for “high-flow” estimation using hydrologic models</title><author><first>N.</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Rakovec</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Wood</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Gupta</last></author><author><first>Rohini</first><last>Kumar</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Calibration is an essential step for improving
the accuracy of simulations generated using hydrologic models. A key modeling
decision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized. It has been
common to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants such
as Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that their
squared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, we
conclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poor
reproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are used
for flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performance
metrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM),
and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basins
throughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are
(1) NSE, (2) Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annual
peak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metric
that focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces the
best annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on other
high-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results in
annual peak flow estimates that are more than 20 % worse, primarily due
to the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On the
other hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that are
better than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean and
variance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect to
other related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of the
components of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulations
based on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics,
regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize that
improving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministically
calibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics
(for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeper
understanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to the
desired goals of model calibration.

The ability of researchers and governments to anticipate, mitigate, and restore eutrophic freshwaters in a cohesive, integrated manner suffers from key uncertainties in our understanding of the watershed-to-lake continuum. Here, we use Lake Erie and its watershed as an example of a system in which there is a pressing need to resolve these uncertainties. In recent history, Lake Erie both suffered and recovered from serious eutrophication and related issues. More recently, however, there has been a resurgence of eutrophication and associated harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, with symptoms reminiscent of prior eutrophication. This resurgence has led the USA and Canadian governments to commit to substantially reducing P inputs into Lake Erie in an effort to control eutrophication. We illustrate how key uncertainties about Lake Erie and its watershed contribute to challenges we face in restoring this ecosystem and propose avenues for their resolution. To this end, we contend that an ecosystem approach will be required for managing the eutrophication of freshwaters.</abstract><url hash="da022860">2019.GWF-1.133</url><doi>10.1086/705915</doi><bibkey>N.

Components of mobile apps (such as 3rd party libraries) require to be separated and analyzed differently for security issue detection, repackaged app detection, tumor code purification and so on. Various techniques are available to automatically analyze mobile apps. However, analysis of the app's executable binary remains challenging due to required curated database, large codebases and obfuscation. Considering these, we focus on exploring a versatile technique to separate different components with design-based features independent of code obfuscation. Particularly, we conducted an empirical study using design patterns and fuzzy signatures to separate app components such as 3rd party libraries. In doing so, we built a system for automatically extracting design patterns from both the executable package (APK) and Jar of an Android application. The experimental results with various standard datasets containing 3rd party libraries, obfuscated apps and malwares reveal that design features like these are present significantly within them (within 60% APKs including malware). Moreover, these features remain unaltered even after app obfuscation. Finally, as a case study, we found that the design patterns alone can detect 3rd party libraries within the obfuscated apps considerably (F1 score is 32%). Overall, our empirical study reveals that design features might play a versatile role in separating various Android components for various purposes.</abstract><url hash="4466bdc3">2019.GWF-1.134</url><doi>10.1109/ASEW.2019.00022</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2019-Automatic</bibkey></paper><paper id="135"><title>Clone-World: A visual analytic system for large scale software clones</title><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

There is a common belief that code cloning (copy/pasting code fragments) can introduce bugs in a software system if the copied code fragments are not properly adapted to their contexts (i.e., surrounding code). However, none of the existing studies have investigated whether such bugs are really present in code clones. We denote these bugs as Context Adaptation Bugs, or simply Context-Bugs, in our paper and investigate the extent to which they can be present in code clones. We define and automatically analyze two clone evolutionary patterns that indicate fixing of Context-Bugs. According to our analysis on thousands of revisions of six open-source subject systems written in Java, C, and C#, code cloning often introduces Context-Bugs in software systems. Around 50% of the clone related bug-fixes can occur for fixing Context-Bugs. Cloning (copy/pasting) a newly created code fragment (i.e., a code fragment that was not added in a former revision) is more likely to introduce Context-Bugs compared to cloning a preexisting fragment (i.e., a code fragment that was added in a former revision). Moreover, cloning across different files appears to have a significantly higher tendency of introducing Context-Bugs compared to cloning within the same file. Finally, Type 3 clones (gapped clones) have the highest tendency of containing Context-Bugs among the three major clone-types. Our findings can be important for early detection as well as removal of Context-Bugs in code clones.</abstract><url hash="dd6fec79">2019.GWF-1.137</url><doi>10.1109/ICSME.2019.00026</doi><bibkey>Mondal-etal-2019-Investigating</bibkey></paper><paper id="138"><title>Changes in streamflow and water temperature affect fish habitat in the Athabasca River basin in the context of climate change</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Sanyal</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Sereda</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4dd0f1e8">2019.GWF-1.138</url><doi>10.1016/J.ECOLMODEL.2019.108718</doi><bibkey>Morales-Marín-etal-2019-Changes</bibkey></paper><paper id="139"><title>Flood Risk Management in Canada’s Prairie Provinces: an Analysis of Decision-Maker Priorities and Policy Preferences</title><author><first>Alasdair</first><last>Morrison</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Noble</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract /><url hash="3ad7c17e">2019.GWF-1.139</url><doi>10.1007/s00267-019-01208-0</doi><bibkey>Morrison-etal-2019-Flood</bibkey></paper><paper id="140"><title>Designing for Real-Time Groupware Systems to Support Complex Scientific Data Analysis</title><author><first>Golam</first><last>Mostaeen</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge no existing SWfMSs directly support collaboration. Data is increasing in complexity, dimensionality, and volume, and the efficient analysis of data often goes beyond the realm of an individual and requires collaboration with multiple researchers from varying domains. In this paper, we propose a groupware system architecture for data analysis that in addition to supporting collaboration, also incorporates features from SWfMSs to support modern data analysis processes. As a proof of concept for the proposed architecture we developed SciWorCS - a groupware system for scientific data analysis. We present two real-world use-cases: collaborative software repository analysis and bioinformatics data analysis. The results of the experiments evaluating the proposed system are promising. Our bioinformatics user study demonstrates that SciWorCS can leverage real-world data analysis tasks by supporting real-time collaboration among users.</abstract><url hash="0c4aef1d">2019.GWF-1.140</url><doi>10.1145/3331151</doi><bibkey>Mostaeen-etal-2019-Designing</bibkey></paper><paper id="141"><title>CloneCognition: machine learning based code clone validation tool</title><author><first>Golam</first><last>Mostaeen</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey</first><last>Svajlenko</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>A.

To detect each possible clone pair from a software system while handling the complex code structures, the clone detection tools undergo a lot of generalization of the original source codes. The generalization often results in returning code fragments that are only coincidentally similar and not considered clones by users, and hence requires manual validation of the reported possible clones by users which is often both time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based tool 'CloneCognition' (Open Source Codes: https://github.com/pseudoPixels/CloneCognition ; Video Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYQjmdr8rsw) to automate the laborious manual validation process. The tool runs on top of any code clone detection tools to facilitate the clone validation process. The tool shows promising clone classification performance with an accuracy of up to 87.4%.

These tools target clone detection in software applications written in a single programming language. However, a software application may be written in different languages for different platforms to improve the application's platform compatibility and adoption by users of different platforms. Cross language clones (CLCs) introduce additional challenges when maintaining multi-platform applications and would likely go undetected using existing tools. In this paper, we propose CLCDSA, a cross language clone detector which can detect CLCs without extensive processing of the source code and without the need to generate an intermediate representation. The proposed CLCDSA model analyzes different syntactic features of source code across different programming languages to detect CLCs. To support large scale clone detection, the CLCDSA model uses an action filter based on cross language API call similarity to discard non-potential clones. The design methodology of CLCDSA is two-fold: (a) it detects CLCs on the fly by comparing the similarity of features, and (b) it uses a deep neural network based feature vector learning model to learn the features and detect CLCs. Early evaluation of the model observed an average precision, recall and F-measure score of 0.55, 0.86, and 0.64 respectively for the first phase and 0.61, 0.93, and 0.71 respectively for the second phase which indicates that CLCDSA outperforms all available models in detecting cross language clones.</abstract><url hash="e2448e31">2019.GWF-1.142</url><doi>10.1109/ASE.2019.00099</doi><bibkey>Wazed Nafi-etal-2019-CLCDSA:</bibkey></paper><paper id="143"><title>Large loss of CO2 in winter observed across the northern permafrost region</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Natali</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Watts</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Rogers</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Potter</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Ludwig</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Selbmann</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Sullivan</last></author><author><first>Benjamin</first><last>W.

Areas with seasonally frozen soils present a particular challenge due to the snowmelt‐dominated hydrology and the impact of soil freezing on the soil hydraulic properties and plant root water uptake. Land surface schemes that have been applied in high latitudes often have reported problems with simulating the snowpack and runoff. Models applied at the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites in central Saskatchewan have consistently over‐predicted evapotranspiration as compared with flux tower estimates. We assessed the performance of two Canadian land surface schemes (CLASS and CLASS‐CTEM) for simulating point‐scale evapotranspiration at an instrumented jack pine sandy upland site in the southern edge of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. Consistent with past reported results, these models over‐predicted evapotranspiration, as compared with flux tower observations, but only in the spring period. Looking systematically at soil properties and vegetation characteristics, we found that the dominant control on evapotranspiration within these models was the canopy conductance. However, the problem of excessive spring ET could not be solved satisfactorily by changing the soil or vegetation parameters. The model overestimation of spring ET coincided with the overestimation of spring soil liquid water content. Improved algorithms for the infiltration of snowmelt into frozen soils and plant‐water uptake during the snowmelt and soil thaw periods may be key to addressing the biases in spring ET.</abstract><url hash="0b272b04">2019.GWF-1.144</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13674</doi><bibkey>Nazarbakhsh-etal-2019-Controls</bibkey></paper><paper id="145"><title>Tails of extremes: Advancing a graphical method and harnessing big data to assess precipitation extremes</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Nerantzaki</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7c201b92">2019.GWF-1.145</url><doi>10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.103448</doi><bibkey>Nerantzaki-etal-2019-Tails</bibkey></paper><paper id="146"><title>Methodological Intercomparisons of Station-Based Gridded Meteorological Products: Utility, Limitations, and Paths Forward</title><author><first>A.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Ryan</first><last>J.

 This study presents a gridded meteorology intercomparison using the State of Hawaii as a testbed. This is motivated by the goal to provide the broad user community with knowledge of interproduct differences and the reasons differences exist. More generally, the challenge of generating station-based gridded meteorological surfaces and the difficulties in attributing interproduct differences to specific methodological decisions are demonstrated. Hawaii is a useful testbed because it is traditionally underserved, yet meteorologically interesting and complex. In addition, several climatological and daily gridded meteorology datasets are now available, which are used extensively by the applications modeling community, thus an intercomparison enhances Hawaiian specific capabilities. We compare PRISM climatology and three daily datasets: new datasets from the University of Hawai‘i and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Daymet version 3 for precipitation and temperature variables only. General conclusions that have emerged are 1) differences in input station data significantly influence the product differences, 2) explicit prediction of precipitation occurrence is crucial across multiple metrics, and 3) attribution of differences to specific methodological choices is difficult and limits the usefulness of intercomparisons. Because generating gridded meteorological fields is an elaborate process with many methodological choices interacting in complex ways, future work should 1) develop modular frameworks that allows users to easily examine the breadth of methodological choices, 2) collate available nontraditional high-quality observational datasets for true out-of-sample validation and make them publicly available, and 3) define benchmarks of acceptable performance for methodological components and products.</abstract><url hash="e5294a28">2019.GWF-1.146</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-18-0114.1</doi><bibkey>Newman-etal-2019-Methodological</bibkey></paper><paper id="147"><title>A High-Resolution Data Assimilation Framework for Snow Water Equivalent Estimation across the Western United States and Validation with the Airborne Snow Observatory</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Oaida</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Reager</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Andreadis</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>David</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Levoe</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Painter</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Bormann</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Trangsrud</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Girotto</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><abstract>
 Numerical simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountain systems can be biased, and few SWE observations have existed over large domains. New approaches for measuring SWE, like NASA’s ultra-high-resolution Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), offer an opportunity to improve model estimates by providing a high-quality validation target. In this study, a computationally efficient snow data assimilation (DA) approach over the western United States at 1.75-km spatial resolution for water years (WYs) 2001–17 is presented. A local ensemble transform Kalman filter implemented as a batch smoother is used with the VIC hydrology model to assimilate the remotely sensed daily MODIS fractional snow-covered area (SCA). Validation of the high-resolution SWE estimates is done against ASO SWE data in the Tuolumne basin (California), Uncompahgre basin (Colorado), and Olympic Peninsula (Washington). Results indicate good performance in dry years and during melt, with DA reducing Tuolumne basin-average SWE percent differences from −68%, −92%, and −84% in open loop to 0.6%, 25%, and 3% after DA for WYs 2013–15, respectively, for ASO dates and spatial extent. DA also improved SWE percent difference over the Uncompahgre basin (−84% open loop, −65% DA) and Olympic Peninsula (26% open loop, −0.2% DA). However, in anomalously wet years DA underestimates SWE, likely due to an inadequate snow depletion curve parameterization. Despite potential shortcomings due to VIC model setup (e.g., water balance mode) or parameterization (snow depletion curve), the DA framework implemented in this study shows promise in overcoming some of these limitations and improving estimated SWE, in particular during drier years or at higher elevations, when most in situ observations cannot capture high-elevation snowpack due to lack of stations there.</abstract><url hash="922e7abe">2019.GWF-1.147</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-18-0009.1</doi><bibkey>Oaida-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="148"><title>Suppression of Biofouling on a Permeable Membrane for Dissolved Oxygen Sensing Using a Lubricant-Infused Coating.</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Osborne</last></author><author><first>Aditya</first><last>Aryasomayajula</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Shakeri</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Selvaganapathy</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Didar</last></author><abstract>Specific ranges of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations must be maintained in a waterbody for it to be hospitable for aquatic animals. DO sensor designs can employ selectively permeable membranes to isolate DO from untargeted compounds or organisms in waterbodies. Hence, the DO concentration can be monitored and the health of the water can be evaluated over time. However, the presence of bacteria in natural waterbodies can lead to the formation of biofilms that can block pores and prevent analyte from permeating the membrane, resulting in inaccurate readings. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a fluorosilane-based omniphobic lubricant-infused (OLI) coating on a selectively permeable membrane and investigate the rate of biofilm formation for a commercially available DO sensor. Coated and unmodified membranes were incubated in an environment undergoing accelerated bacterial growth, and the change in sensitivity was evaluated after 40, 100, 250, and 500 h. Our findings show that the OLI membranes attenuate biofouling by 70% and maintain sensitivity after 3 weeks of incubation, further demonstrating that oxygen transfer through the OLI coating is achievable. Meanwhile, unmodified membranes exhibit significant biofouling that results in a 3.35 higher rate of decay in oxygen measurement sensitivity and an over 70% decrease in static contact angle. These results show that the OLI coating can be applied on commercially available membranes to prevent biofouling. Therefore, OLI coatings are a suitable candidate to suppress biofilm formation in the widespread use of selectively permeable membranes for environmental, medical, and fluid separation applications.</abstract><url hash="0291672f">2019.GWF-1.148</url><doi>10.1021/acssensors.8b01541</doi><bibkey>Osborne-etal-2019-Suppression</bibkey></paper><paper id="149"><title>A review of economic approaches modeling the complex interactions between forest management and watershed services</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Ovando</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><abstract /><url hash="759657b9">2019.GWF-1.149</url><doi>10.1016/J.FORPOL.2018.12.007</doi><bibkey>Ovando-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="150"><title>Bedload Sediment Transport Regimes of Semi‐alluvial Rivers Conditioned by Urbanization and Stormwater Management</title><author><first>E.</first><last>Papangelakis</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>MacVicar</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Ashmore</last></author><abstract>Watershed urbanization and stormwater management (SWM) alter the hydrologic processes of rivers. Although differences have been documented in channel morphology and sediment yield pre‐ and posturbanization, little is known about how the modified hydrology affects grain‐scale bedload transport dynamics. This study aims to characterize the bedload sediment transport regime of three rivers with different hydrologic settings: rural, urban with no SWM, and urban with peak‐shaving SWM. The rivers are “semi‐alluvial,” characterized by an alluvial layer over a cohesive till. Bedload transport was monitored using tracer stones over 3 years. Hydrograph characteristics of the streams fit with what is expected in urban and SWM systems, and the rural stream has an episodic transport regime typical of gravel‐bed rivers. Entrainment thresholds are not detectably impacted by the semi‐alluvial bed cover, but travel lengths of grains relative to their size are longer than in alluvial gravel‐bed streams. Downstream displacement rates of particles up to the D90 are accelerated in the urban river due to more frequent mobilization rather than increased event‐based travel lengths and may explain channel enlargement. SWM decreases the mobility and travel lengths of particles below those in the rural system, which is combined with channel narrowing, and the loss of bed forms suggests a shift toward a competence‐limited transport regime. This new regime is a result of reduced shear stresses that are insufficient to transport coarse material. This study presents empirical evidence of the effects of watershed urbanization and SWM on bedload transport and provides recommendations for process‐based river management strategies.</abstract><url hash="1551de5c">2019.GWF-1.150</url><doi>10.1029/2019WR025126</doi><bibkey>Papangelakis-etal-2019-Bedload</bibkey></paper><paper id="151"><title>Is the Northern Permafrost Zone a Source or a Sink for Carbon?</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Parmentier</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Mauritz</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Virkkala</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Schuur</last></author><abstract>Thawing permafrost could release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, but finding out how much requires better collection and curation of data.</abstract><url hash="6256eeca">2019.GWF-1.151</url><doi>10.1029/2019eo130507</doi><bibkey>Parmentier-etal-2019-Is</bibkey></paper><paper id="152"><title>Estimation of depression-focussed groundwater recharge using chloride mass balance: problems and solutions across scales</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Pavlovskii</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Cey</last></author><abstract /><url hash="fb5fbf70">2019.GWF-1.152</url><doi>10.1007/s10040-019-01993-2</doi><bibkey>Pavlovskii-etal-2019-Estimation</bibkey></paper><paper id="153"><title>Quantifying terrain controls on runoff retention and routing in the Northern Prairies</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Pavlovskii</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Noorduijn</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Liggett</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Klassen</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><abstract>The role of hummocky terrain in governing runoff routing and focussing groundwater recharge in the Northern Prairies of North America is widely recognised. However, most hydrological studies in the region have not effectively utilised information on the surficial geology and associated landforms in large‐scale hydrological characterization. The present study uses an automated digital elevation model (DEM) analysis of a 6500‐km2 area in the Northern Prairies to quantify hydrologically relevant terrain parameters for the common types of terrains in the prairies with different surficial deposits widespread in the prairies, namely, moraines and glaciolacustrine deposits. Runoff retention (and storage) capacity within depressions varies greatly between different surficial deposits and is comparable in magnitude with a typical amount of seasonal snowmelt runoff generation. The terrain constraint on potential runoff retention varies from a few millimetres in areas classified as moraine to tens of millimetres in areas classified as stagnant ice moraine deposits. Fluted moraine and glaciolacustrine deposits have intermediate storage capacity values. The study also identified the probability density function describing a number of immediate upstream neighbours for each depression in a fill‐and‐spill network. A relationship between depression parameters and surficial deposits, as well as identified depression network structure, allows parametrisation of hydrologic models outside of the high‐resolution DEM coverage, which can still account for terrain variation in the Prairies.</abstract><url hash="8c588fe6">2019.GWF-1.153</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13599</doi><bibkey>Pavlovskii-etal-2019-Quantifying</bibkey></paper><paper id="154"><title>Multi-year evaluation of airborne geodetic surveys to estimate seasonal mass balance, Columbia and Rocky Mountains, Canada</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Pelto</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Marshall</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Seasonal measurements of glacier mass balance provide
insight into the relation between climate forcing and glacier change. To
evaluate the feasibility of using remotely sensed methods to assess seasonal
balance, we completed tandem airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys and
field-based glaciological measurements over a 4-year period for six
alpine glaciers that lie in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains, near the
headwaters of the Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada. We calculated
annual geodetic balance using coregistered late summer digital elevation
models (DEMs) and distributed estimates of density based on surface
classification of ice, snow, and firn surfaces. Winter balance was derived
using coregistered late summer and spring DEMs, as well as density measurements
from regional snow survey observations and our glaciological measurements.
Geodetic summer balance was calculated as the difference between winter and
annual balance. Winter mass balance from our glaciological observations
averaged 1.95±0.09 m w.e. (meter water equivalent), 4 % larger than those derived from
geodetic surveys. Average glaciological summer and annual balance were 3 %
smaller and 3 % larger, respectively, than our geodetic estimates. We find
that distributing snow, firn, and ice density based on surface classification
has a greater influence on geodetic annual mass change than the density
values themselves. Our results demonstrate that accurate assessments of
seasonal mass change can be produced using ALS over a series of glaciers
spanning several mountain ranges. Such agreement over multiple seasons,
years, and glaciers demonstrates the ability of high-resolution geodetic

Natural wetlands constitute the largest and most uncertain source
of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere and a large fraction of them are found in the northern latitudes. These emissions are typically estimated using process (“bottom-up”) or inversion (“top-down”) models. However, estimates from these two types of models are not independent of each other since the top-down estimates usually rely on the a priori estimation of these emissions obtained with process models. Hence, independent spatially explicit validation data are needed. Here we utilize a random forest (RF) machine-learning technique to upscale CH4 eddy covariance flux measurements from 25 sites to estimate CH4 wetland emissions from the northern latitudes (north of 45∘ N). Eddy covariance data
from 2005 to 2016 are used for model development. The model is then used to predict emissions during 2013 and 2014. The predictive performance of the RF model is evaluated using a leave-one-site-out cross-validation scheme. The performance (Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency =0.47) is comparable to previous studies upscaling net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and studies comparing process model output against site-level CH4 emission data. The global distribution of wetlands is one major source of uncertainty for upscaling CH4. Thus, three wetland distribution maps are utilized in the upscaling. Depending on the wetland distribution map, the annual emissions for the northern wetlands yield 32 (22.3–41.2, 95 % confidence interval calculated from a RF model ensemble), 31 (21.4–39.9) or 38 (25.9–49.5) Tg(CH4) yr−1. To further evaluate the uncertainties of the upscaled CH4 flux data products we also compared them against output from two process models (LPX-Bern and WetCHARTs), and methodological issues related to CH4 flux upscaling are discussed. The monthly upscaled CH4 flux data products are available at

understanding of how changes in seasonal and perennial frozen ground
disposition and linked storage dynamics affect runoff generation processes
remains limited. Storage dynamics and water redistribution are influenced by
the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of frozen ground, snow
accumulation and melt. Stable isotopes are potentially useful for quantifying the
dynamics of water sources, flow paths and ages, yet few studies have employed
isotope data in permafrost-influenced catchments. Here, we applied the
conceptual model STARR (the Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall–Runoff model), which facilitates fully distributed simulations of hydrological
storage dynamics and runoff processes, isotopic composition and water ages.
We adapted this model for a subarctic catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada,
with a time-variable implementation of field capacity to include the
influence of thaw dynamics. A multi-criteria calibration based on stream
flow, snow water equivalent and isotopes was applied to 3 years of data.
The integration of isotope data in the spatially distributed model provided
the basis for quantifying spatio-temporal dynamics of water storage and ages,
emphasizing the importance of thaw layer dynamics in mixing and damping the
melt signal. By using the model conceptualization of spatially and temporally
variable storage, this study demonstrates the ability of tracer-aided
modelling to capture thaw layer dynamics that cause mixing and damping of the
isotopic melt signal.

Much of the current understanding of P dynamics in agricultural systems has been obtained from rainfall-driven runoff, and less is known about cold-season processes. An improved understanding of the magnitude, form, and transport flow paths of P losses from agricultural croplands year round, and the climatic drivers of these processes, is needed to prioritize and evaluate appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to protect soil-water quality in cold regions. This study examines multiyear, year-round, high-frequency edge-of-field P losses (soluble reactive P and total P [TP]) in overland flow and tile drainage from three croplands in southern Ontario, Canada. Annual and seasonal budgets for water, P, and estimates of field P budgets (including fertilizer inputs, crop uptake, and runoff) were calculated for each site. Annual edge-of-field TP loads ranged from 0.18 to 1.93 kg ha yr (mean = 0.59 kg ha yr) across the region, including years with fertilizer application. Tile drainage dominated runoff across sites, whereas the contribution of tiles and overland flow to P loss differed regionally, likely related to site-specific topography, soil type, and microclimate. The nongrowing season was the dominant period for runoff and P loss across sites, where TP loss during this period was often associated with overland flow during snowmelt. These results indicate that emphasis should be placed on BMPs that are effective during both the growing and nongrowing season in cold regions, but that the suitability of various BMPs may vary for different sites.</abstract><url hash="1b8a566e">2019.GWF-1.158</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.11.0418</doi><bibkey>Plach-etal-2019-Agricultural</bibkey></paper><paper id="159"><title>Role of sublimation and riming in the precipitation distribution in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, Canada</title><author><first>E.</first><last>Poirier</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Leriche</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The phase of precipitation and its distribution at the surface can affect water resources and the regional water cycle of a region. A field project was held in March–April 2015 on the eastern slope of the Canadian Rockies to document precipitation characteristics and associated atmospheric conditions. During the project, 60 % of the particles documented were rimed in relatively warm and dry conditions. Rain–snow transitions also occurred aloft and at the surface in sub-saturated conditions. Ice-phase precipitation falling through a saturated atmospheric layer with temperatures &gt; 0 ∘C will start melting. In contrast, if the melting layer is sub-saturated, the ice-phase precipitation undergoes sublimation, which increases the depth of the rain–snow transition. In this context, this study investigates the role of sublimation and riming in precipitation intensity and type reaching the surface in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, during March–April 2015. To address this, a set of numerical simulations of an event of mixed precipitation observed at the surface was conducted. This event on 31 March 2015 was documented with a set of devices at the main observation site (Kananaskis Emergency Services, KES), including a precipitation gauge, disdrometer, and micro rain radar. Sensitivity experiments were performed to assess the impacts of temperature changes from sublimation and the role of the production of graupel (riming) aloft in the surface precipitation evolution. A warmer environment associated with no temperature changes from sublimation leads to a peak in the intensity of graupel at the surface. When the formation of graupel is not considered, the maximum snowfall rate occurred at later times. Results suggest that unrimed snow reaching the surface is formed on the western flank and is advected eastward. In contrast, graupel would form aloft in the Kananaskis Valley. The cooling from sublimation and melting by rimed particles increases the vertical shear near KES. Overall, this study illustrated that the presence of graupel influenced the surface evolution of precipitation type in the valley due to the horizontal transport of precipitation particles.

Identifying the underlying causes is challenging, and thus, solving the problem remains difficult. To better understand the reasons for the leaky pipeline, we assess the perceptions and impacts of gender bias and imbalance—two major drivers of the leakage—at different academic career levels with an anonymous survey in geoscience academia (n=1,220). The survey results show that both genders view male geoscientists as substantially more gender biased than female scientists. Moreover, female geoscientists are more than twice as likely to experience negative gender bias at their workplaces and scientific organizations compared to male geoscientists. There are also pronounced gender differences regarding (i) the relevance of role models, (ii) family‐friendly working conditions, and (iii) the approval of gender quotas for academic positions. Given the male dominance in senior career levels, our results emphasize that those feeling less impacted by the negative consequences of gender bias and imbalance are the ones in position to tackle the problem. We thus call for actions to better address gender biases and to ensure a balanced gender representation at decision‐making levels to ultimately retain more women in geoscience academia.</abstract><url hash="3e7c8d9f">2019.GWF-1.160</url><doi>10.1029/2019EA000706</doi><bibkey>Popp-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="161"><title>A synthesis of three decades of hydrological research at Scotty Creek, NWT, Canada</title><author><first>W.</first><last>Quinton</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Braverman</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Carpino</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Chasmer</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Connon</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Craig</last></author><author><first>É.</first><last>Devoie</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Haynes</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Olefeldt</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Pietroniro</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Rezanezhad</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Schincariol</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, has
been the focus of hydrological research for nearly three decades. Over this
period, field and modelling studies have generated new insights into the
thermal and physical mechanisms governing the flux and storage of water in
the wetland-dominated regions of discontinuous permafrost that characterises
much of the Canadian and circumpolar subarctic. Research at Scotty Creek
has coincided with a period of unprecedented climate warming, permafrost
thaw, and resulting land cover transformations including the expansion of
wetland areas and loss of forests. This paper (1) synthesises field and
modelling studies at Scotty Creek, (2) highlights the key insights of these
studies on the major water flux and storage processes operating within and
between the major land cover types, and (3) provides insights into the rate
and pattern of the permafrost-thaw-induced land cover change and how such
changes will affect the hydrology and water resources of the study region.

These models have been calibrated using the Multiscale Parameter Regionalization scheme in a joint, multibasin approach using 492 medium‐sized basins across the CONUS yielding spatially distributed model parameter sets. The mHM simulations are used as a performance benchmark to examine performance deficiencies in the VIC model. We find that after calibration to streamflow, VIC generally overestimates the magnitude and temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) as compared to mHM as well as the FLUXNET observation‐based ET product, resulting in underestimation of the mean and variability of runoff. We perform a controlled calibration experiment to investigate the effect of varying number of transfer function parameters in mHM and to enable a fair comparison between both models (14 and 48 for mHM vs. 14 for VIC). Results of this experiment show similar behavior of mHM with 14 and 48 parameters. Furthermore, we diagnose the internal functioning of the VIC model by looking at the relationship of the evaporative fraction versus the degree of soil saturation and compare it with that of the mHM model, which has a different model structure, a prescribed nonlinear relationship between these variables and exhibits better model skill than VIC. Despite these limitations, the VIC‐based CONUS‐wide calibration constrained against streamflow exhibits better ET skill as compared to two preexisting independent VIC studies.</abstract><url hash="d072ecb3">2019.GWF-1.162</url><doi>10.1029/2019JD030767</doi><bibkey>Rakovec-etal-2019-Diagnostic</bibkey></paper><paper id="163"><title>Are the effects of vegetation and soil changes as important as climate

Hydrological processes are widely understood to be sensitive to changes in climate, but the effects of changes in vegetation and soils have seldom been considered. The response of mountain hydrology to future climate and vegetation/soil changes is modelled in three snowmelt dominated mountain basins in the North American Cordillera. A Cold Regions Hydrological Model developed for each basin was driven with perturbed observed meteorological time series. Monthly perturbations were developed from differences in eleven regional climate model outputs between the present and future scenarios. Future climate change in these basins results in decreased modelled peak snow water equivalent (SWE) but increased evapotranspiration in all basins. All three watersheds became more rainfall-dominated. In Wolf Creek in the Yukon Territory, an insignificant increasing effect of vegetation change on peak SWE was found to be important enough to offset the significant climate change effect on alpine snow. In Marmot Creek in the Canadian Rockies, a combined effect of soil and climate changes on increasing annual runoff becomes significant while their individual effects are not statistically significant. In the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain East catchment in Idaho, USA, only vegetation change decreases annual runoff volume and changes in soil, climate, or combination of them do not affect runoff. At high elevations in Wolf and Marmot Creeks, modelled vegetation/soil changes moderated the impact of climate change on peak SWE, the timing of peak SWE, evapotranspiration, and annual runoff volume. At medium elevations, these changes intensified the impact of climate change, decreasing peak SWE, and sublimation. The modelled hydrological impacts of changes in climate, vegetation, and soil in mountain environments are similar in magnitude but not consistently in the direction in all biomes; in some combinations, this results in enhanced impacts at lower elevations and latitudes and offsetting effects at higher elevations and latitudes.

 How mountain hydrology at different elevations will respond to climate change is a challenging question of great importance to assessing changing water resources. Here, three North American Cordilleran snow-dominated basins—Wolf Creek, Yukon; Marmot Creek, Alberta; and Reynolds Mountain East, Idaho—each with good meteorological and hydrological records, were modeled using the physically based, spatially distributed Cold Regions Hydrological Model. Model performance was verified using field observations and found adequate for diagnostic analysis. To diagnose the effects of future climate, the monthly temperature and precipitation changes projected for the future by 11 regional climate models for the mid-twenty-first century were added to the observed meteorological time series. The modeled future was warmer and wetter, increasing the rainfall fraction of precipitation and shifting all three basins toward rainfall–runoff hydrology. This shift was largest at lower elevations and in the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain East. In the warmer future, there was decreased blowing snow transport, snow interception and sublimation, peak snow accumulation, and melt rates, and increased evapotranspiration and the duration of the snow-free season. Annual runoff in these basins did not change despite precipitation increases, warming, and an increased prominence of rainfall over snowfall. Reduced snow sublimation offset reduced snowfall amounts, and increased evapotranspiration offset increased rainfall amounts. The hydrological uncertainty due to variation among climate models was greater than the predicted hydrological changes. While the results of this study can be used to assess the vulnerability and resiliency of water resources that are dependent on mountain snow, stakeholders and water managers must make decisions under considerable uncertainty, which this paper illustrates.</abstract><url hash="39114986">2019.GWF-1.164</url><doi>10.1175/JHM-D-18-0166.1</doi><bibkey>Rasouli-etal-2019-Hydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="165"><title>A multi-method Generalized Global Sensitivity Matrix approach to accounting for the dynamical nature of earth and environmental systems models</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Gupta</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4e167910">2019.GWF-1.165</url><doi>10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2018.12.002</doi><bibkey>Razavi-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="166"><title>VARS-TOOL: A toolbox for comprehensive, efficient, and robust sensitivity and uncertainty analysis</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Gupta</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Haghnegahdar</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d71f28aa">2019.GWF-1.166</url><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.10.005</doi><bibkey>Razavi-etal-2019-VARS-TOOL:</bibkey></paper><paper id="167"><title>Delineating extent and magnitude of river flooding to lakes across a northern delta using water isotope tracers</title><author><first>C.</first><last>Remmer</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Owca</last></author><author><first>Laura</first><last>K Neary</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Wiklund</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Kay</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Hall</last></author><abstract>Hydrological monitoring in complex, dynamic northern floodplain landscapes is challenging, but increasingly important as a consequence of multiple stressors. The Peace‐Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta, Canada, is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance reliant on episodic river ice‐jam flood events to recharge abundant perched lakes and wetlands. Improved and systematic monitoring of landscape‐scale hydrological connectivity among freshwater ecosystems (rivers, channels, wetlands, and lakes) is needed to guide stewardship decisions in the face of climate change and upstream industrial development. Here, we use water isotope compositions, supplemented by measurements of specific conductivity and field observations, from 68 lakes and 9 river sites in May 2018 to delineate the extent and magnitude of spring ice‐jam induced flooding along the Peace and Athabasca rivers. Lake‐specific estimates of input water isotope composition (δI) were modelled after accounting for influence of evaporative isotopic enrichment. Then, using the distinct isotopic signature of input water sources, we develop a set of binary mixing models and estimate the proportion of input to flooded lakes attributable to river floodwater and precipitation (snow or rain). This approach allowed identification of areas and magnitude of flooding that were not captured by other methods, including direct observations from flyovers, and to demarcate flow pathways in the delta. We demonstrate water isotope tracers as an efficient and effective monitoring tool for delineating spatial extent and magnitude of an important hydrological process and elucidating connectivity in the Peace‐Athabasca Delta, an approach that can be readily adopted at other floodplain landscapes.</abstract><url hash="a018183c">2019.GWF-1.167</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13585</doi><bibkey>Remmer-etal-2019-Delineating</bibkey></paper><paper id="168"><title>A Regional-Scale Index for Assessing the Exposure of Drinking-Water Sources to Wildfires</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Robinne</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Bladon</last></author><author><first>U.</first><last>Siliņš</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Emelko</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Flannigan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Parisien</last></author><author><first>Xianli</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Kienzle</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Dupont</last></author><abstract>Recent human-interface wildfires around the world have raised concerns regarding the reliability of freshwater supply flowing from severely burned watersheds. Degraded source water quality can often be expected after severe wildfire and can pose challenges to drinking water facilities by straining treatment response capacities, increasing operating costs, and jeopardizing their ability to supply consumers. Identifying source watersheds that are dangerously exposed to post-wildfire hydrologic changes is important for protecting community drinking-water supplies from contamination risks that may lead to service disruptions. This study presents a spatial index of watershed exposure to wildfires in the province of Alberta, Canada, where growing water demands coupled with increasing fire activity threaten municipal drinking-water supplies. Using a multi-criteria analysis design, we integrated information regarding provincial forest cover, fire danger, source water volume, source-water origin (i.e., forested/un-forested), and population served. We found that (1) &gt;2/3 of the population of the province relies on drinking-water supplies originating in forested watersheds, (2) forest cover is the most important variable controlling final exposure scores, and (3) watersheds supplying small drinking water treatment plants are particularly exposed, especially in central Alberta. The index can help regional authorities prioritize the allocation of risk management resources to mitigate adverse impacts from wildfire. The flexible design of this tool readily allows its deployment at larger national and continental scales to inform broader water security frameworks.</abstract><url hash="30a705ad">2019.GWF-1.168</url><doi>10.3390/F10050384</doi><bibkey>Robinne-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="169"><title>A novel tool for measuring the penetration of the ecosystem service concept into public policy</title><author><first>F.</first><last>Robinne</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Gallagher</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Bréthaut</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Schlaepfer</last></author><abstract /><url hash="47a0353b">2019.GWF-1.169</url><doi>10.1016/J.ECOSER.2019.100914</doi><bibkey>Robinne-etal-2019-A1</bibkey></paper><paper id="170"><title>Correlation among parameters and boundary conditions in river ice models</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2767bcde">2019.GWF-1.170</url><doi>10.1007/s40808-019-00696-7</doi><bibkey>Rokaya-etal-2019-Correlation</bibkey></paper><paper id="171"><title>Climatic effects on ice phenology and ice-jam flooding of the Athabasca River in western Canada</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Morales-Marín</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Bonsal</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT In cold region environments, any alteration in the hydro-climatic regime can have profound impacts on river ice processes. This paper studies the implications of hydro-climatic trends on river ice processes, particularly on the freeze-up and ice-cover breakup along the Athabasca River in Fort McMurray in western Canada, which is an area very prone to ice-jam flooding. Using a stochastic approach in a one-dimensional hydrodynamic river ice model, a relationship between overbank flow and breakup discharge is established. Furthermore, the likelihood of ice-jam flooding in the future (2041–2070 period) is assessed by forcing a hydrological model with meteorological inputs from the Canadian regional climate model driven by two atmospheric–ocean general circulation climate models. Our results show that the probability of ice-jam flooding for the town of Fort McMurray in the future will be lower, but extreme ice-jam flood events are still probable.</abstract><url hash="50608c48">2019.GWF-1.171</url><doi>10.1080/02626667.2019.1638927</doi><bibkey>Rokaya-etal-2019-Climatic</bibkey></paper><paper id="172"><title>Modelling the effects of climate and flow regulation on ice‐affected backwater staging in a large northern river</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Peters</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Bonsal</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>In cold region environments, ice‐jam floods (IJFs) pose a severe risk to local communities, economies, and ecosystems. Previous studies have shown that both climate and regulation affect IJF probabilities, but their relative impacts are poorly understood. This study presents a probabilistic modelling framework that couples hydrologic and hydraulic models to assess the relative role of regulated and naturalized flows on ice‐affected backwater staging. The framework is evaluated at an IJF‐prone town on the Peace River in western Canada, which has been regulated since 1972. Naturalized flows were generated for the comparison, and ice‐affected backwater profiles were calculated along jams of varying length and location and for different combinations of model parameters and boundary conditions. Results show significant differences in backwater staging (~2 m for a return period of T = 1:10 year) between two study time periods (1973–1992 vs 1993–2012) as compared with two different hydraulic flow conditions (regulated vs naturalized), suggesting a larger role of climate than regulation in backwater staging. However, regulation was found to offset flood risk during the 1973–1992 period and exacerbate flood risk during the 1993–2012 period.</abstract><url hash="c969ddf2">2019.GWF-1.172</url><doi>10.1002/rra.3436</doi><bibkey>Rokaya-etal-2019-Modelling</bibkey></paper><paper id="173"><title>Promoting Sustainable Ice-Jam Flood Management along the Peace River and Peace-Athabasca Delta</title><author><first>P.</first><last>Rokaya</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>AbstractThe regulation of rivers has always been a controversial issue, with potential benefits but also environmental impacts.

Yet a common North American amphibian, the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), ranges widely and persists in agricultural landscapes. Conventional survey techniques rely on visual encounters and dip‐netting efforts, but detectability limits the ability to test for the effects of environmental variables on amphibian habitat suitability. We used environmental DNA to determine the presence of wood frogs and an amphibian pathogen (ranavirus) in Prairie Pothole wetlands and investigated the effects of 32 water quality, wetland habitat, and landscape‐level variables on frog presence at sites representing different degrees of agricultural intensity. Several wetland variables influenced wood frog presence, the most influential being those associated with wetland productivity (i.e., nutrients), vegetation buffer width, and proportion of the surrounding landscape that is comprised of other water bodies. Wood frog presence was positively associated with higher dissolved phosphorus (&gt;0.4 mg/L), moderate dissolved nitrogen (0.1–0.2 mg/L), lower chlorophyll a (≤15 µg/L), wider vegetation buffers (≥10 m), and more water on the landscape (≥0.25). These results highlight the effects of environmental factors at multiple scales on the presence of amphibians in this highly modified landscape—namely the importance of maintaining wetland water quality, vegetation buffers, and surrounding habitat heterogeneity.

Spatial variability in snowpack properties negatively impacts our capacity
to make direct measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) using satellites.
A comprehensive data set of snow microstructure (94 profiles at 36 sites)
and snow layer thickness (9000 vertical profiles across nine trenches)
collected over two winters at Trail Valley Creek, NWT, Canada, was applied
in synthetic radiative transfer experiments. This allowed for robust assessment
of the impact of estimation accuracy of unknown snow microstructural
characteristics on the viability of SWE retrievals. Depth hoar layer
thickness varied over the shortest horizontal distances, controlled by
subnivean vegetation and topography, while variability in total snowpack
thickness approximated that of wind slab layers. Mean horizontal correlation
lengths of layer thickness were less than a metre for all layers. Depth hoar was
consistently ∼30 % of total depth, and with increasing
total depth the proportion of wind slab increased at the expense of the
decreasing surface snow layer. Distinct differences were evident between
distributions of layer properties; a single median value represented density
and specific surface area (SSA) of each layer well. Spatial variability in
microstructure of depth hoar layers dominated SWE retrieval errors. A depth
hoar SSA estimate of around 7 % under the median value was needed to
accurately retrieve SWE. In shallow snowpacks &lt;0.6 m, depth hoar SSA
estimates of ±5 %–10 % around the optimal retrieval SSA allowed SWE
retrievals within a tolerance of ±30 mm. Where snowpacks were deeper
than ∼30 cm, accurate values of representative SSA for depth
hoar became critical as retrieval errors were exceeded if the median depth
hoar SSA was applied.

These code snippets often contain ambiguous undeclared external references. Such external references make it difficult to learn and use those APIs correctly. In particular, reusing code snippets containing such ambiguous undeclared external references requires significant manual efforts and expertise to resolve them. Manually resolving fully qualified names (FQN) of API elements is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel context-sensitive technique, called COSTER, to resolve FQNs of API elements in such code snippets. The proposed technique collects locally specific source code elements as well as globally related tokens as the context of FQNs, calculates likelihood scores, and builds an occurrence likelihood dictionary (OLD). Given an API element as a query, COSTER captures the context of the query API element, matches that with the FQNs of API elements stored in the OLD, and rank those matched FQNs leveraging three different scores: likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity scores. Evaluation with more than 600K code examples collected from GitHub and two different Stack Overflow datasets shows that our proposed technique improves precision by 4-6% and recall by 3-22% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed technique significantly reduces the training time compared to the StatType, a state-of-the-art technique, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive analyses on results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique.</abstract><url hash="b903297d">2019.GWF-1.177</url><doi>10.1109/ASE.2019.00032</doi><bibkey>Saifullah-etal-2019-Learning</bibkey></paper><paper id="178"><title>Determination of fire risk to assist fire management for insular areas: the case of a small Greek island</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Sakellariou</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Tampekis</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Samara</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Flannigan</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Jaeger</last></author><author><first>O.</first><last>Christopoulou</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Sfougaris</last></author><abstract /><url hash="29bc34ec">2019.GWF-1.178</url><doi>10.1007/s11676-018-0666-x</doi><bibkey>Sakellariou-etal-2019-Determination</bibkey></paper><paper id="179"><title>Seasonality of Phosphorus and Nitrate Retention in Riparian Buffers.</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Satchithanantham</last></author><author><first>Blair</first><last>English</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><abstract>Measurement of the retention of dissolved nutrients in riparian areas with snowmelt runoff are much less common than for rainfall runoff, but low rates of uptake or the release of nutrients with snowmelt have been attributed to frozen soils, lower biotic uptake, and release of nutrients from senesced vegetation. In the research presented here, we evaluate whether the potential for uptake of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and NO differ significantly between snowmelt and summer seasons with flow through 13 riparian buffers downstream of cropland in Manitoba, Canada. Flow-through buffers in small channels are typical in this landscape, and pulsed releases of a conservative tracer and dissolved nutrients were used to measure uptake rates. Although mean uptake rates of NO were higher in summer than for snowmelt, responses varied widely. Aerial uptake rate of DRP showed a significant negative relationships with soil Olsen-P ( = 0.54, &lt; 0.001) and a P saturation index ( = 0.48, &lt; 0.001) across both seasons. Biological processes may be of greater importance for NO retention, but DRP retention appears to be driven by adsorption-desorption regardless of season. Olsen-P is identified as a good indicator of potential for release or retention of DRP in riparian buffers with fine-textured calcareous soils, for both snowmelt and summer seasons. Soil testing may be a good tool to aid in the siting of new buffers and to track the effectiveness of management interventions to remove P from riparian areas, such as harvest of vegetation.</abstract><url hash="5ebb047a">2019.GWF-1.179</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.07.0280</doi><bibkey>Satchithanantham-etal-2019-Seasonality</bibkey></paper><paper id="180"><title>Simulating the convective precipitation diurnal cycle in North America’s current and future climate</title><author><first>L.</first><last>Scaff</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Prein</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Changhai</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Ikeda</last></author><abstract /><url hash="a0ffa011">2019.GWF-1.180</url><doi>10.1007/s00382-019-04754-9</doi><bibkey>Scaff-etal-2019-Simulating</bibkey></paper><paper id="181"><title>Detroit River phosphorus loads: Anatomy of a binational watershed</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Scavia</last></author><author><first>Serghei</first><last>A.

Our objective was to determine the effect of agroecosystem management on snowmelt runoff and nutrient losses from a long-term field experiment at Swift Current, SK. Runoff quantity, nutrient concentrations, and loads were estimated after a change in management from conventionally tilled wheat ( L.)-fallow (Conv W-F) to no-till wheat-fallow and subsequently no-till wheat-pulse (NT W-F/LP) and to an organic system with a wheat-green manure rotation (Org W-GM). The conversion from conventional tillage practices to no-till increased snowmelt runoff likely due to snow trapping by standing stubble after summer fallow. Relatedly, runoff after no-till summer fallow had higher dissolved P losses (0.07 kg P ha). Replacing summer fallow with a pulse crop in the no-till rotation decreased snowmelt runoff losses and nutrient concentrations. The Org W-GM treatment had the lowest P loss after stubble (0.02 kg P ha) but had high dissolved P concentrations in snowmelt following the green manure (0.55 mg P L), suggesting a contribution from incorporated crop residues. In this semiarid climate with little runoff, dissolved reactive P and NO-N loads in snowmelt runoff were smaller than those reported elsewhere on the prairies (averaging &lt;0.05 kg P ha yr, and &lt;0.2 kg NO-N ha yr); however, the nutrient concentrations we observed, in particular for P, even without P fertilizer addition for organic production, question the practicality of agricultural management systems in this region meeting water quality guidelines.</abstract><url hash="39f6f1ab">2019.GWF-1.183</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.12.0448</doi><bibkey>Schneider-etal-2019-Nutrient</bibkey></paper><paper id="184"><title>Can Improved Flow Partitioning in Hydrologic Models Increase Biogeochemical Predictability?</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Shafii</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Craig</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>English</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Van Cappellen</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Basu</last></author><abstract>Hydrologic models partition flows into surface and subsurface pathways, but their calibration is typically conducted only against streamflow. Here we argue that unless model outcomes are constrained using flow pathway data, multiple partitioning schemes can lead to the same streamflow. This point becomes critical for biogeochemical modeling as individual flow paths may yield unique chemical signatures. We show how information on flow pathways can be used to constrain hydrologic flow partitioning and how improved partitioning can lead to better water quality predictions. As a case study, an agricultural basin in Ontario is used to demonstrate that using tile discharge data could increase the performance of both the hydrology and the nitrogen transport models. Watershed‐scale tile discharge was estimated based on sparse tile data collected at some tiles using a novel regression‐based approach. Through a series of calibration experiments, we show that utilizing tile flow signatures as calibration criteria improves model performance in the prediction of nitrate loads in both the calibration and validation periods. Predictability of nitrate loads is improved even with no tile flow data and by model calibration only against an approximate understanding of annual tile flow percent. However, despite high values of goodness‐of‐fit metrics in this case, temporal dynamics of predictions are inconsistent with reality. For instance, the model predicts significant tile discharge in summer with no tile flow occurrence in the field. Hence, the proposed tile flow upscaling approach and the partitioning‐constrained model calibration are vital steps toward improving the predictability of biogeochemical models in tiled landscapes.</abstract><url hash="a7926408">2019.GWF-1.184</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR024487</doi><bibkey>Shafii-etal-2019-Can</bibkey></paper><paper id="185"><title>Variability and trends of landfalling atmospheric rivers along the Pacific Coast of northwestern North America</title><author><first>Aseem</first><last>R.

Moreover, we present the synoptic evolution and distribution of LARs in BCSAK during different phases of ocean–atmosphere climate variability using a six‐hourly AR catalogue from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research. During 1948–2016, BCSAK averages 35 ± 5 LARs annually, with the highest frequency during fall (13 ± 2) and lowest during spring (5 ± 2). The frequency of LARs across BCSAK rises during the study period, and the increase between 1979 and 2016 is statistically significant (p &lt; .05). A strong ridge over the Pacific Northwest and BC and a trough over the Gulf of Alaska and the Northeastern Pacific Ocean favours AR landfalls at the higher and lower latitudes, respectively. BCSAK experiences greater numbers of LARs during neutral phases of El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the 2013/2014 Pacific oceanic blob, and during the positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern.</abstract><url hash="d095549e">2019.GWF-1.185</url><doi>10.1002/joc.6227</doi><bibkey>R.

Complex, software-intensive, technically advanced, and
computationally demanding models, presumably with ever-growing realism and
fidelity, have been widely used to simulate and predict the dynamics of the
Earth and environmental systems. The parameter-induced simulation crash
(failure) problem is typical across most of these models despite
considerable efforts that modellers have directed at model development and
implementation over the last few decades. A simulation failure mainly occurs
due to the violation of numerical stability conditions, non-robust
numerical implementations, or errors in programming. However, the existing
sampling-based analysis techniques such as global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
methods, which require running these models under many configurations of
parameter values, are ill equipped to effectively deal with model failures.
To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach that allows users to cope
with failed designs (samples) when performing GSA without rerunning the
entire experiment. This approach deems model crashes as missing data and
uses strategies such as median substitution, single nearest-neighbor, or
response surface modeling to fill in for model crashes. We test the
proposed approach on a 10-parameter HBV-SASK (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning modified by the second author for educational purposes) rainfall–runoff model and a
111-parameter Modélisation
Environmentale–Surface et Hydrologie (MESH) land surface–hydrology model. Our results show that
response surface modeling is a superior strategy, out of the data-filling
strategies tested, and can comply with the dimensionality of the model,
sample size, and the ratio of the number of failures to the sample size.
Further, we conduct a “failure analysis” and discuss some possible causes
of the MESH model failure that can be used for future model improvement.

Unfortunately, they face two major problems. First, the search is impaired due to a lexical gap between their query (task description) and the information associated with the solution. Second, the retrieved solution may not be comprehensive, i.e., the code segment might miss a succinct explanation. These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q&amp;A threads and then mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier studies. We evaluate our approach using 97 programming queries, of which 50% was used for training and 50% was used for testing, and show that it outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, our evaluation with 29 developers using 24 tasks (queries) confirms the superiority of CROKAGE over the state-of-art tool in terms of relevance of the suggested code examples, benefit of the code explanations and the overall solution quality (code + explanation).</abstract><url hash="ae242823">2019.GWF-1.188</url><doi>10.1109/ICPC.2019.00054</doi><bibkey>F.

The assumption of stationarity in water resources no longer holds, particularly within the context of future climate change. Plausible scenarios of flows that fluctuate outside the envelope of variability of the gauging data are required to assess the robustness of water resource systems to future conditions. This study presents a novel method of generating weekly time step flows based on tree-ring chronology data. Specifically, this method addresses two long-standing challenges with paleo-reconstruction: (i) the typically limited predictive power of tree-ring data at the annual and sub-annual scale and (ii) the inflated short-term persistence in tree-ring time series and improper use of pre-whitening. Unlike the conventional approach, this method establishes relationships between tree-ring chronologies and naturalized flow at a biennial scale to preserve persistence properties and variability of hydrological time series. Biennial flow reconstructions are further disaggregated to weekly flow reconstructions, according to the weekly flow distribution of reference 2-year instrumental periods, identified as periods with broadly similar tree-ring properties to those of every 2-year paleo-period. The Saskatchewan River basin (SaskRB) in Western Canada is selected as a study area, and weekly flows in its four major tributaries are extended back to the year 1600. The study shows that the reconstructed flows properly preserve the statistical properties of the reference flows, particularly in terms of short- to long-term persistence and the structure of variability across timescales. An ensemble approach is presented to represent the uncertainty inherent in the statistical relationships and disaggregation method.

Despite decades of efforts to keep P on agricultural fields and reduce losses to waterways, frequent algal blooms persist, triggering not only ecological disruption but also economic, social, and political consequences. We investigate historical and persistent factors affecting agricultural P mitigation in a transect of major watersheds across North America: Lake Winnipeg, Lake Erie, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Okeechobee/Everglades. These water bodies span 26 degrees of latitude, from the cold climate of central Canada to the subtropics of the southeastern United States. These water bodies and their associated watersheds have tracked trajectories of P mitigation that manifest remarkable similarities, and all have faced challenges in the application of science to agricultural management that continue to this day. An evolution of knowledge and experience in watershed P mitigation calls into question uniform solutions as well as efforts to transfer strategies from other arenas. As a result, there is a need to admit to shortcomings of past approaches, plotting a future for watershed P mitigation that accepts the sometimes two-sided nature of Hennig Brandt's "Devil's Element."</abstract><url hash="b9e49150">2019.GWF-1.190</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.03.0136</doi><bibkey>Smith-etal-2019-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="191"><title>Model-data fusion of hydrologic simulations and GRACE terrestrial water storage observations to estimate changes in water table depth</title><author><first>D.</first><last>Stampoulis</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Reager</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>David</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Andreadis</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Farr</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Trangsrud</last></author><author><first>R.</first><last>Basilio</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Sabo</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Osterman</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Lundgren</last></author><author><first>Zhen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract /><url hash="cee3a1c6">2019.GWF-1.191</url><doi>10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2019.04.004</doi><bibkey>Stampoulis-etal-2019-Model-data</bibkey></paper><paper id="192"><title>Summary and synthesis of Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) research in the interior of western Canada – Part 1: Projected climate and meteorology</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><author><first>K.</first><last>Szeto</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Bonsal</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Hanesiak</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Kochtubajda</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>Benita</first><last>Y.

The interior of western Canada, up to and including the Arctic,
has experienced rapid change in its climate, hydrology, cryosphere, and
ecosystems, and this is expected to continue. Although there is general
consensus that warming will occur in the future, many critical issues
remain. In this first of two articles, attention is placed on
atmospheric-related issues that range from large scales down to individual
precipitation events. Each of these is considered in terms of expected
change organized by season and utilizing mainly “business-as-usual” climate
scenario information. Large-scale atmospheric circulations affecting this
region are projected to shift differently in each season, with conditions
that are conducive to the development of hydroclimate extremes in the domain
becoming substantially more intense and frequent after the mid-century. When
coupled with warming temperatures, changes in the large-scale atmospheric
drivers lead to enhancements of numerous water-related and
temperature-related extremes. These include winter snowstorms, freezing
rain, drought, forest fires, as well as atmospheric forcing of spring floods,
although not necessarily summer convection. Collective insights of these
atmospheric findings are summarized in a consistent, connected physical
framework.

Predicting discharge from headwater basins in this region depends upon understanding and numerically representing the interactions between storage and discharge within and between the major land cover types and how these interactions are changing. To better understand the implications of advanced permafrost thaw‐induced land cover change on wetland discharge, with all landscape features capable of contributing to drainage networks, the hydrological behaviour of a channel fen sub‐basin in the headwaters of Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada, dominated by peat plateau–bog complexes, was modelled using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform for the period of 2009 to 2015. The model construction was based on field water balance observations, and performance was deemed adequate when evaluated against measured water balance components. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of progressive permafrost loss on discharge from the sub‐basin, in which all units of the sub‐basin have the potential to contribute to the drainage network, by incrementally reducing the ratio of wetland to plateau in the modelled sub‐basin. Simulated reductions in permafrost extent decreased total annual discharge from the channel fen by 2.5% for every 10% decrease in permafrost area due to increased surface storage capacity, reduced run‐off efficiency, and increased landscape evapotranspiration. Runoff ratios for the fen hydrological response unit dropped from 0.54 to 0.48 after the simulated 50% permafrost area loss with a substantial reduction of 0.47 to 0.31 during the snowmelt season. The reduction in peat plateau area resulted in decreased seasonal variability in discharge due to changes in the flow path routing, with amplified low flows associated with small increases in subsurface discharge, and decreased peak discharge with large reductions in surface run‐off.</abstract><url hash="be895549">2019.GWF-1.194</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13546</doi><bibkey>Stone-etal-2019-Modelling</bibkey></paper><paper id="195"><title>Influence of the Model Horizontal Resolution on Atmospheric Conditions Leading to Freezing Rain in Regional Climate Simulations</title><author><first>Médéric</first><last>St-Pierre</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Paquin</last></author><abstract>Abstract Freezing rain occurs in complex atmospheric conditions when the temperature is close to 0°C. To better understand how its occurrence will change in the future, there is a need to assess how well regional climate models can reproduce those conditions. The goal of the present study is to investigate the influence of horizontal resolution on the simulation of freezing rain using the fifth generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). Three CRCM5 simulations driven by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) over eastern North America at resolutions of 0.11°, 0.22°, and 0.44° were conducted over a period of 36 years (1979–2014). Freezing rain is diagnosed using an in-line diagnostic method for precipitation partitioning. A climatological study of annual and seasonal accumulated freezing rain was conducted. In addition, the ability of the three simulations to reproduce individual freezing rain events was evaluated. Our analyses include frequency and partitioning of different precipitation types and comparisons with observations. All simulations reproduced the climatology of freezing rain sufficiently well and show similar large-scale patterns. The number of freezing rain events tends to be overestimated at higher resolution and underestimated at lower resolution. Despite the overestimation, detailed maxima associated with freezing rain are well defined and located at higher resolution, notably in regions of the St. Lawrence River Valley. Overall, this study is consistent with other added-value studies, generally showing a mix of improvement and deterioration in the precipitation fields by the higher resolution simulations.</abstract><url hash="c98e65df">2019.GWF-1.195</url><doi>10.1080/07055900.2019.1583088</doi><bibkey>St-Pierre-etal-2019-Influence</bibkey></paper><paper id="196"><title>Representing Intrahillslope Lateral Subsurface Flow in the Community Land Model</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Swenson</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Ying</first><last>Fan</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Lawrence</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Perket</last></author><abstract>The concept of using representative hillslopes to simulate hydrologically similar areas of a catchment has been incorporated in many hydrologic models but few Earth system models. Here we describe a configuration of the Community Land Model version 5 in which each grid cell is decomposed into one or more multicolumn hillslopes. Within each hillslope, the intercolumn connectivity is specified, and the lateral saturated subsurface flow from each column is passed to its downslope neighbor. We first apply the model to simulate a headwater catchment and assess the results against runoff and evapotranspiration flux measurements. By redistributing soil water within the catchment, the model is able to reproduce the observed difference between evapotranspiration in the upland and lowland portions of the catchment. Next, global simulations based on hypothetical hillslope geomorphic parameters are used to show the model's sensitivity to differences in hillslope shape and discretization. Differences in evapotranspiration between upland and lowland hillslope columns are found to be largest in arid and semiarid regions, while humid tropical and high‐latitude regions show limited evapotranspiration increases in lowlands relative to uplands.</abstract><url hash="50873465">2019.GWF-1.196</url><doi>10.1029/2019MS001833</doi><bibkey>Swenson-etal-2019-Representing</bibkey></paper><paper id="197"><title>Contributions of GRACE to understanding climate change</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Tapley</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Watkins</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Flechtner</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Reigber</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Bettadpur</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Rodell</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Sasgen</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>F.</first><last>Landerer</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Chambers</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Reager</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Gardner</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Save</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Ivins</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Swenson</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Boening</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Dahle</last></author><author><first>D.</first><last>Wiese</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Dobslaw</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Tamisiea</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Velicogna</last></author><abstract /><url hash="278004f3">2019.GWF-1.197</url><doi>10.1038/s41558-019-0456-2</doi><bibkey>Tapley-etal-2019-Contributions</bibkey></paper><paper id="198"><title>Identifying Climate-Induced Groundwater Depletion in GRACE Observations</title><author><first>B.</first><last>Thomas</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b73f1962">2019.GWF-1.198</url><doi>10.1038/s41598-019-40155-y</doi><bibkey>Thomas-etal-2019-Identifying</bibkey></paper><paper id="199"><title>Permafrost collapse is accelerating carbon release</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><author><first>Benjamin</first><last>W.

Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (&lt;10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration.</abstract><url hash="6a609440">2019.GWF-1.200</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.13626</doi><bibkey>Van Huizen-etal-2019-Seasonal</bibkey></paper><paper id="201"><title>Response to Comment on “Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico”</title><author><first>K.</first><last>V.

However, because the spatial resolution of existing land cover datasets is too coarse, large‐scale land cover changes in the Arctic–Boreal region (ABR) have been poorly characterized. Here, we use 31 years (1984–2014) of moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite imagery over a region spanning 4.7 × 106 km2 in Alaska and northwestern Canada to characterize regional‐scale ABR land cover changes. We find that 13.6 ± 1.3% of the domain has changed, primarily via two major modes of transformation: (a) simultaneous disturbance‐driven decreases in Evergreen Forest area (−14.7 ± 3.0% relative to 1984) and increases in Deciduous Forest area (+14.8 ± 5.2%) in the Boreal biome; and (b) climate‐driven expansion of Herbaceous and Shrub vegetation (+7.4 ± 2.0%) in the Arctic biome. By using time series of 30 m imagery, we characterize dynamics in forest and shrub cover occurring at relatively short spatial scales (hundreds of meters) due to fires, harvest, and climate‐induced growth that are not observable in coarse spatial resolution (e.g., 500 m or greater pixel size) imagery. Wildfires caused most of Evergreen Forest Loss and Evergreen Forest Gain and substantial areas of Deciduous Forest Gain. Extensive shifts in the distribution of plant functional types at multiple spatial scales are consistent with observations of increased atmospheric CO2 seasonality and ecosystem productivity at northern high‐latitudes and signal continental‐scale shifts in the structure and function of northern high‐latitude ecosystems in response to climate change.</abstract><url hash="6d0d5059">2019.GWF-1.204</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14804</doi><bibkey>A.

A set of precipitation and temperature‐based indices were computed using the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi‐model ensemble projections at 8 km resolution over the 21st Century for two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The results show that this region is expected to experience stronger warming and a higher increase in precipitation extremes in future. Generally, projected changes in minimum temperature will be greater than changes in maximum temperature, as shown by respective indices. A decrease in frost days and an increase in warm nights will be expected. By 2100 there will be no cool nights and cool days. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures will increase by 12 and 7°C, respectively, under the RCP8.5 scenario, when compared with the reference period 1981–2000. The highest warming in minimum temperature and decrease in cool nights and days will occur in Ontario and Quebec provinces close to the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay. The highest warming in maximum temperature will occur in the southern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Annual total precipitation is expected to increase by about 16% and the occurrence of heavy precipitation events by five days. The highest increase in annual total precipitation will occur in the northern parts of Ontario and Quebec and in western British Columbia.</abstract><url hash="f40401e3">2019.GWF-1.207</url><doi>10.1002/met.1861</doi><bibkey>Wazneh-etal-2019-Climate</bibkey></paper><paper id="208"><title>Identifying the groundwater sustainability implications of water policy in high-use situations in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin</title><author><first>Khafi</first><last>Weekes</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Krantzberg</last></author><author><first>Maria</first><last>Vizeu Pinheiro</last></author><abstract>Abstract Although the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin contains the largest global store of fresh water, long-term groundwater storage (GWS) decline has been observed in some aquifers supplying communities that intensely use the resource.

In this context, we examine policies, from the binational to municipal governance levels, to identify features that can lead to GWS decline in aquifers supplying these communities. As the physical-environmental characteristics determining sustainable yield span many climates and geological settings within the Basin, our findings highlight the need for policies to adapt to local conditions.

In cold climates, strong seasonality affects natural wetlands and those constructed for water treatment alike, raising important questions about how ecosystems can be managed to maximize nutrient retention in the landscape, particularly in light of rapid and ongoing wetland loss. This study assessed how freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) affect the release of phosphorus (P) from common riparian macrophytes (Typha spp). The goal was to understand whether the freeze-thaw processes could drive enhanced nutrient release as has been shown for agricultural residues, but which has not previously been assessed in riparian vegetation. Given the rapid expansion of Phragmites australis in parts of the study area, this study also tested the effects of FTC on P release from Phragmites tissue. A common experimental protocol was used across 11 wetlands in three regions of Canada. These results demonstrate the potential for FTCs to induce P release from macrophyte tissue, although this is not observed in all cases. The impact of FTCs on P release was greatest and most consistent when samples were collected earlier in the growing season. Release rates were positively correlated with plant P content. This suggests that the degree of plant senescence may play a role in determining the response to FTCs. Typha and Phragmites showed similar responses to FTCs, suggesting that the importance of this process does not depend on the dominant taxon. Sequential FTCs led to further enhancement of P release from macrophyte tissue.

Peat smouldering can emit large quantities of carbon and smoke to the atmosphere, and therefore can contribute to hazardous air quality. The wildland-industry interface and wildland-urban interface are both extensive across the sub-humid boreal plains (BP) ecozone where one-third of the area is covered by peatlands. As such, there is a growing research need to identify drivers of variability in smouldering combustion. This study uses hydrophysical peat properties to assess the drivers of cross-scale variability in peat smouldering combustion vulnerability in forested peatlands across the BP. Using a space-for-time chronosequence across the 120-year fire return interval and three main hydrogeological settings, and by incorporating hummock, hollow and margin locations, cross-scale variability is studied. We find that, based on peat properties such as specific yield (Sy) and gravimetric water content, forested peatland margins represent areas of high peat smouldering vulnerability, and that this is exacerbated with an increasing time-since-fire (stand-age). Although increasing Sy with time-since-fire in peatland middles may buffer water table drawdown, when accounting for increases in canopy fuel load, transpiration, and feather moss dominance forested peatland middles also become more vulnerable to smouldering combustion with time-since-fire. Moreover, the interaction of peatland margins with coarse- and heterogeneous-grained hydrogeological settings leads to lower Sy and higher density margin peat than in fine-grained settings, further increasing smouldering vulnerability. We estimate that forested peatland margins are vulnerable to combustion throughout their entire profile i.e. burn-out, under moderate-high water deficits in the BP. Furthermore, we identify peatland margin: total area ratio as a driver of smouldering vulnerability where small peatlands that are periodically disconnected from regional groundwater systems are the most vulnerable to high total peat carbon loss. We suggest that these drivers of cross-scale variability should be incorporated into peatland and wildfire management strategies, especially in areas near the wildland-industry and wildland-urban interface.</abstract><url hash="9d75c42d">2019.GWF-1.212</url><doi>10.3389/ffgc.2019.00084</doi><bibkey>Wilkinson-etal-2019-Assessing</bibkey></paper><paper id="213"><title>Threshold peat burn severity breaks evaporation‐limiting feedback</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Wilkinson</last></author><author><first>Gregory</first><last>J.

Here, we examine how peat burn severity and water table depth (WTD) affect the strength of one such feedback—the hydrophobicity–evaporation feedback (HEF). The HEF is an evaporation‐limiting feedback known to minimize water loss following wildfire. The peatland surface becomes hydrophobic creating an evaporative cap and thereby reducing post‐fire evaporation; however, recent studies hypothesize that this is dependent on peat burn severity. To test this hypothesis, we studied plots along a peat burn severity gradient in a partially drained black spruce peatland that burned during the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. Evaporation rates were significantly lower in plots where hydrophobicity was present. Hydrophobicity was lowest in the severely burned area, and the average instantaneous evaporation rate (2.75 mm day−1) was significantly higher than moderately and typical‐lightly burned areas (0.82 and 1.64 mm day−1, respectively). Based on lab results, increasing WTD affected hydrophobicity within lightly burned (singed) feather moss samples but not in heavily burned feather moss, showing the importance of post‐fire ground cover and in situ WTD. Our results provide evidence of a burn severity threshold where increased depth of burn removes the feather moss evaporative cap and causes the HEF to break down. We argue that this threshold has important implications for boreal peatlands, which are predicted to undergo climate‐mediated pre‐fire drying and increasing burn severities, potentially leading to further carbon losses due to enhanced post‐fire drying and concomitant decomposition.</abstract><url hash="ea72f4bb">2019.GWF-1.213</url><doi>10.1002/eco.2168</doi><bibkey>Wilkinson-etal-2019-Threshold</bibkey></paper><paper id="214"><title>Landscape Controls on Nutrient Export during Snowmelt and an Extreme Rainfall Runoff Event in Northern Agricultural Watersheds.</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Casson</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Glenn</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Badiou</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Boychuk</last></author><abstract>In the northern Great Plains, most runoff transport of N, and P to surface waters has historically occurred with snowmelt. In recent years, significant rainfall runoff events have become more frequent and intense in the region. Here, we examine the influence of landscape characteristics on hydrology and nutrient export in nine tributary watersheds of the Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada, during snowmelt runoff and with an early summer extreme rainfall runoff event (ERRE). All watersheds included in the study have land use that is primarily agricultural, but with differing proportions of land remaining as wetlands, grassland, and that has been artificially drained. Those watersheds with greater capacity for storage of water in surface depressions (noneffective contributing areas) exhibited lower rates of runoff and nutrient export with snowmelt. During the ERRE, higher export of total P (TP), but not total N, was observed from those watersheds with larger amounts of contributing area that had been added through artificial surface drainage, and this was associated primarily with higher TP concentrations. Increasing or restoring the storage of water on the landscape is likely to reduce nutrient export; however, the importance of antecedent conditions was evident during the ERRE, when small surface depressions were at or near capacity from snowmelt. Total P concentrations observed during the summer ERRE were as high as those observed with snowmelt, and N/P ratios were significantly lower. If the frequency of summer ERREs increases with climate change, this is likely to result in negative water quality outcomes.</abstract><url hash="74166118">2019.GWF-1.214</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2018.07.0278</doi><bibkey>Wilson-etal-2019-Landscape</bibkey></paper><paper id="215"><title>Near-Surface Soils as a Source of Phosphorus in Snowmelt Runoff from Cropland.</title><author><first>H.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Glenn</last></author><abstract>In northern regions, a high proportion of annual runoff and phosphorus (P) export from cropland occurs with snowmelt. In this study, we analyze 57 site-years of field-scale snowmelt runoff data from 16 small watersheds draining fine-textured soils (clay or clay loam) in Manitoba, Canada. These fields were selected across gradients of soil P (2.4 to 26.7 mg kg, 0- to 15-cm Olsen P), tillage intensity (high frequency to long-term no-till), and fertilizer input. The strongest predictor of flow-weighted mean concentrations of total dissolved P (TDP) in snowmelt runoff was Olsen P in the top 5 cm of soil ( = 0.45, &lt; 0.01). Residual variation in this relationship related positively to volumetric soil moisture and negatively to water yield. Although Olsen P levels were relatively consistent from year to year, suggesting control by long-term fertilization and tillage history, Olsen P stratification (ratio of 0-5/0-15 cm) increased with rates of fertilizer application. Particulate P (PP) comprised &lt;34% of total P on average, and concentrations were not well predicted by soil or management characteristics. Loads of PP and TDP exported during snowmelt were primarily a function of water yield and size of accumulated snowpack; however, residual variation in the TDP relationship correlated positively with both soil moisture and Olsen P. Retention of runoff water on the landscape could reduce loads, but careful management of near-surface soil P is required to prevent snowmelt runoff losses of P at the source and to reduce the potential for the eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems.</abstract><url hash="0311518e">2019.GWF-1.215</url><doi>10.2134/JEQ2019.04.0155</doi><bibkey>Wilson-etal-2019-Near-Surface</bibkey></paper><paper id="216"><title>Land cover and landform-based upscaling of soil organic carbon stocks on the Brøgger Peninsula, Svalbard</title><author><first>R.</first><last>Wojcik</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Palmtag</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Hugelius</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Weiss</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Kuhry</last></author><abstract>ABSTRACT In this study we assess the total storage, landscape distribution, and vertical partitioning of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks on the Brøgger Peninsula, Svalbard. This type of high Arctic area is underrepresented in SOC databases for the northern permafrost region. Physico-chemical, elemental, and radiocarbon (14C) dating analyses were carried out on thirty-two soil profiles. Results were upscaled using both a land cover classification (LCC) and a landform classification (LFC). Both LCC and LFC approaches provide weighted mean SOC 0–100 cm estimates for the study area of 1.0 ± 0.3 kg C m−2 (95% confidence interval) and indicate that about 68 percent of the total SOC storage occurs in the upper 30 cm of the soil, and about 10 percent occurs in the surface organic layer. Furthermore, LCC and LFC upscaling approaches provide similar spatial SOC allocation estimates and emphasize the dominant role of “vegetated area” (4.2 ± 1.6 kg C m−2) and “solifluction slopes” (6.7 ± 3.6 kg C m−2) in SOC 0–100 cm storage. LCC and LFC approaches report different and complementary information on the dominant processes controlling the spatial and vertical distribution of SOC in the landscape. There is no evidence for any significant SOC storage in the permafrost layer. We hypothesize, therefore, that the Brøgger Peninsula and similar areas of the high Arctic will become net carbon sinks, providing negative feedback on global warming in the future. The surface area that will have vegetation cover and incipient soil development will expand, whereas only small amounts of organic matter will experience increased decomposition due to active-layer deepening.</abstract><url hash="9a180034">2019.GWF-1.216</url><doi>10.1080/15230430.2019.1570784</doi><bibkey>Wojcik-etal-2019-Land</bibkey></paper><paper id="217"><title>A watershed classification approach that looks beyond hydrology: application to a semi-arid, agricultural region in Canada</title><author><first>Jared</first><last>D.

Classification and clustering approaches provide a means to group watersheds
according to similar attributes, functions, or behaviours, and can aid in
managing natural resources. Although they are widely used, approaches based
on hydrological response parameters restrict analyses to regions where
well-developed hydrological records exist, and overlook factors contributing
to other management concerns, including biogeochemistry and ecology. In the
Canadian Prairie, hydrometric gauging is sparse and often seasonal.
Moreover, large areas are endorheic and the landscape is highly modified by
human activity, complicating classification based solely on hydrological
parameters. We compiled climate, geological, topographical, and land-cover
data from the Prairie and conducted a classification of watersheds using a
hierarchical clustering of principal components. Seven classes were
identified based on the clustering of watersheds, including those
distinguishing southern Manitoba, the pothole region, river valleys, and
grasslands. Important defining variables were climate, elevation, surficial
geology, wetland distribution, and land cover. In particular, three classes
occur almost exclusively within regions that tend not to contribute to major
river systems, and collectively encompass the majority of the study area.
The gross difference in key characteristics across the classes suggests that
future water management and climate change may carry with them heterogeneous
sets of implications for water security across the Prairie. This emphasizes
the importance of developing management strategies that target sub-regions
expected to behave coherently as current human-induced changes to the
landscape will affect how watersheds react to change. The study provides the
first classification of watersheds within the Prairie based on climatic and
biophysical attributes, with the framework used being applicable to other
regions where hydrometric data are sparse. Our findings provide a foundation
for addressing questions related to hydrological, biogeochemical, and
ecological behaviours at a regional level, enhancing the capacity to address
issues of water security.

It has an important impact on downstream software applications such as bug detection, code completion, software analysis, etc. Recently, CCAligner made an attempt to detect the code clones with insertions or deletions in one place, which were called large-gap clones. Our contribution is to develop a novel and effective detection approach of large-variance clones to more general cases for not only the concentrated code modifications but also the scattered code modifications. A detector named LVMapper is proposed, borrowing and changing the approach of sequencing alignment in bioinformatics which can find two similar sequences with more differences. The ability of LVMapper was tested on 8 open source projects datasets, and the results show that LVMapper detected more than 5 times of large-variance clones compared with other state-of-the-art tools including CCAligner.

It is important to understand and quantify how forest carbon fluxes respond to heat and drought stress. In this study, we developed a series of daily indices of sensitivity to heat and drought stress as indicated by air temperature (Ta) and evaporative fraction (EF). Using normalized daily carbon fluxes from the FLUXNET Network for 34 forest sites in North America, the seasonal pattern of sensitivities of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) in response to Ta and EF anomalies were compared for different forest types. The results showed that warm temperatures in spring had a positive effect on NEP in conifer forests but a negative impact in deciduous forests. GEP in conifer forests increased with higher temperature anomalies in spring but decreased in summer. The drought‐induced decrease in NEP, which mostly occurred in the deciduous forests, was mostly driven by the reduction in GEP. In conifer forests, drought had a similar dampening effect on both GEP and RE, therefore leading to a neutral NEP response. The NEP sensitivity to Ta anomalies increased with increasing mean annual temperature. Drier sites were less sensitive to drought stress in summer. Natural forests with older stand age tended to be more resilient to the climate stresses compared to managed younger forests. The results of the Classification and Regression Tree analysis showed that seasons and ecosystem productivity were the most powerful variables in explaining the variation of forest sensitivity to heat and drought stress. Our results implied that the magnitude and direction of carbon flux changes in response to climate extremes are highly dependent on the seasonal dynamics of forests and the timing of the climate extremes.</abstract><url hash="2f51c654">2019.GWF-1.221</url><doi>10.1111/gcb.14843</doi><bibkey>Xu-etal-2019-Seasonal</bibkey></paper><paper id="222"><title>Representation and improved parameterization of reservoir operation in hydrological and land-surface models</title><author><first>Fuad</first><last>Yassin</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Elshamy</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Davison</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Sapriza-Azuri</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Reservoirs significantly affect flow regimes in watershed systems by changing the magnitude and timing of streamflows. Failure to represent these effects limits the performance of hydrological and land-surface models (H-LSMs) in the many highly regulated basins across the globe
and limits the applicability of such models to investigate the futures of
watershed systems through scenario analysis (e.g., scenarios of climate,
land use, or reservoir regulation changes). An adequate representation of
reservoirs and their operation in an H-LSM is therefore essential for a
realistic representation of the downstream flow regime. In this paper, we
present a general parametric reservoir operation model based on piecewise-linear relationships between reservoir storage, inflow, and release to
approximate actual reservoir operations. For the identification of the model
parameters, we propose two strategies: (a) a “generalized”
parameterization that requires a relatively limited amount of data and
(b) direct calibration via multi-objective optimization when more data on
historical storage and release are available. We use data from 37 reservoir
case studies located in several regions across the globe for developing and
testing the model. We further build this reservoir operation model into the
MESH (Modélisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie) modeling system, which is a large-scale H-LSM. Our results across the
case studies show that the proposed reservoir model with both
parameter-identification strategies leads to improved simulation accuracy
compared with the other widely used approaches for reservoir operation
simulation. We further show the significance of enabling MESH with this
reservoir model and discuss the interdependent effects of the simulation
accuracy of natural processes and that of reservoir operations on the overall
model performance. The reservoir operation model is generic and can be
integrated into any H-LSM.

Hydrologic-Land Surface Models (H-LSMs) have been progressively developed to a stage where they represent the dominant hydrological processes for a variety of hydrological regimes and include a range of water management practices, and are increasingly used to simulate water storages and fluxes of large basins under changing environmental conditions across the globe. However, efforts for comprehensive evaluation of the utility of H-LSMs in large, regulated watersheds have been limited. In this study, we evaluated the capability of a Canadian H-LSM, called MESH, in the highly regulated Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB), Canada, under the constraint of significant precipitation uncertainty. The SaskRB is a complex system characterized by hydrologically-distinct regions that include the Rocky Mountains, Boreal Forest, and the Prairies. This basin is highly vulnerable to potential climate change and extreme events. A comprehensive analysis of the MESH model performance was carried out in two steps. First, the reliability of multiple precipitation products was evaluated against climate station observations and based on their performance in simulating streamflow across the basin when forcing the MESH model with a default parameterization. Second, a state-of-the-art multi-criteria calibration approach was applied, using various observational information including streamflow, storage and fluxes for calibration and validation. The first analysis shows that the quality of precipitation products had a direct and immediate impact on simulation performance for the basin headwaters but effects were dampened when going downstream. In particular, the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) performed the best among the precipitation products in capturing timings and minimizing the magnitude of error against observation, despite a general underestimation of precipitation amount. The subsequent analyses show that the MESH model was able to capture observed responses of multiple fluxes and storage across the basin using a global multi-station calibration method. Despite poorer performance in some basins, the global parameterization generally achieved better model performance than a default model parameterization. Validation using storage anomaly and evapotranspiration generally showed strong correlation with observations, but revealed potential deficiencies in the simulation of storage anomaly over open water areas.

It has been reported that using the amplitude gating alone may result in false positive events in analyzing data with a poor signal-to-noise ratio. Transit time (τ) can be set as a gating threshold along with side-scattered light or fluorescent light signals in the detection of particles/cells using a microflow cytometer. In this study, transit time of microspheres was studied systematically when the microspheres passed through a laser beam in a microflow cytometer and side-scattered light was detected. A clear linear relationship between the inverse of the average transit time and total flow rate was found. Transit time was used as another gate (other than the amplitude of side-scattering signals) to distinguish real scattering signals from noise. It was shown that the relative difference of the measured microsphere concentration can be reduced significantly from the range of 3.43%–8.77% to the range of 8.42%–111.76% by employing both amplitude and transit time as gates in analysis of collected scattering data. By using optimized transit time and amplitude gate thresholds, a good correlation with the traditional hemocytometer-based particle counting was achieved (R2 &gt; 0.94). The obtained results suggest that the transit time could be used as another gate together with the amplitude gate to improve measurement accuracy of particle/cell concentration for microfluidic devices.</abstract><url hash="b13553f7">2019.GWF-1.226</url><doi>10.3390/s20010014</doi><bibkey>Zhang-etal-2019-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="227"><title>Modeling groundwater responses to climate change in the Prairie Pothole Region</title><author><first>Zhe</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Barlage</last></author><author><first>Fei</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Miguez-Macho</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Ireson</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Shallow groundwater in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is predominantly recharged by snowmelt in the spring and supplies water for
evapotranspiration through the summer and fall. This two-way exchange is
underrepresented in current land surface models. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change on the groundwater recharge rates are uncertain. In this
paper, we use a coupled land–groundwater model to investigate the
hydrological cycle of shallow groundwater in the PPR and study its response
to climate change at the end of the 21st century. The results show that the

mean water table depth (WTD) is well simulated, except for the fact that the model predicts
a deep WTD in northwestern Alberta. The most significant change under future
climate conditions occurs in the winter, when warmer temperatures change the rain/snow partitioning, delaying the time for snow accumulation/soil
freezing while advancing early melting/thawing. Such changes lead to an
earlier start to a longer recharge season but with lower recharge rates.
Different signals are shown in the eastern and western PPR in the future
summer, with reduced precipitation and drier soils in the east but little
change in the west. The annual recharge increased by 25 % and 50 % in
the eastern and western PPR, respectively. Additionally, we found that the mean
and seasonal variation of the simulated WTD are sensitive to soil properties; thus, fine-scale soil information is needed to improve groundwater simulation on the regional scale.

In addition to delivering dissolved elements from land to sea, fresh SGD forms a natural barrier against salinization of coastal aquifers. Here we estimate groundwater discharge rates through the near‐global coast (60°N to 60°S) at high resolution using a water budget approach. We find that tropical coasts export more than 56% of all fresh SGD, while midlatitude arid regions export only 10%. Fresh SGD rates from tectonically active margins (coastlines along tectonic plate boundaries) are also significantly greater than passive margins, where most field studies have been focused. Active margins combine rapid uplift and weathering with high rates of fresh SGD and may therefore host exceptionally large groundwater‐borne solute fluxes to the coast.</abstract><url hash="414dc783">2019.GWF-1.230</url><doi>10.1029/2019GL082749</doi><bibkey>Zhou-etal-2019-Fresh</bibkey></paper><paper id="231"><title>The Arsenic Binding Aptamer Cannot Bind Arsenic: Critical Evaluation of Aptamer Selection and Binding.</title><author><first>Chenghua</first><last>Zong</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>An arsenic binding aptamer named Ars-3 was reported in 2009, and it has been used for detection of As(III) in more than two dozen papers. In this work, we performed extensive binding assays using isothermal titration calorimetry, DNA staining dyes, and gold nanoparticles, respectively. By carefully comparing Ars-3 and a few random control DNA sequences, no specific binding of As(III) was observed in each case. Therefore, we conclude that Ars-3 cannot bind As(III). Possible reasons for some of the previously reported binding and detection were speculated to be related to the adsorption of As(III) onto gold surfaces, which were used in many related sensor designs, and As(III)/Au interactions were not considered before. The selection data in the original paper were then analyzed from sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, and dissociation constant measurement. These steps need rigorous testing before confirming specific binding of newly selected aptamers. This study calls for attention to the gap between aptamer selection and biosensor design, and the gap needs to be carefully filled by careful binding assays to further the growth of the aptamer field.</abstract><url hash="364af715">2019.GWF-1.231</url><doi>10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02789</doi><bibkey>Zong-etal-2019-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="232"><title>Fine-Scale SAR Soil Moisture Estimation in the Subarctic Tundra</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Zwieback</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><abstract>In the subarctic tundra, soil moisture information can benefit permafrost monitoring and ecological studies, but fine-scale remote-sensing approaches are lacking. We explore the suitability of C-band SAR, paying attention to two challenges soil moisture retrieval faces. First, the microtopography and the heterogeneous organic soils impart unique microwave scattering properties, even in absence of noteworthy shrub cover. Empirically, we find the polarimetric response is highly random (entropies &gt;0.7). The randomness limits the applicability of purely polarimetric approaches to soil moisture estimation, as it causes a tailor-made decomposition to break down. For comparison, the L-band scattering response is more surfacelike, also in terms of its angular characteristics. The second challenge concerns the large spatial but small temporal variability of soil moisture observed at our site. Accordingly, the Radarsat-2 C-band backscatter has a limited dynamic range (~2 dB). However, contrary to polarimetric indicators, it shows a clear surface soil moisture signal. To account for the small dynamic range while retaining a 100-m spatial resolution, we embed an empirical time-series model in a Bayesian framework. This framework adaptively pools information from neighboring grid cells, thus increasing the precision. The retrieved soil moisture index achieves correlations of 0.3–0.5 with in situ data at 5 cm depth and, upon calibration, root-mean-square errors of &lt;0.04 m3m−3. As this approach is applicable to Sentinel-1 data, it can potentially provide frequent soil moisture estimates across large regions. In the long term, L-band data hold greater promise for operational retrievals.</abstract><url hash="af43a6af">2019.GWF-1.232</url><doi>10.1109/TGRS.2019.2893908</doi><bibkey>Zwieback-etal-2019-Fine-Scale</bibkey></paper><paper id="233"><title>Improving Permafrost Modeling by Assimilating Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture</title><author><first>S.</first><last>Zwieback</last></author><author><first>S.</first><last>Westermann</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Langer</last></author><author><first>J.</first><last>Boike</last></author><author><first>P.</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Berg</last></author><abstract>Knowledge of soil moisture conditions is important for modeling soil temperatures, as soil moisture influences the thermal dynamics in multiple ways. However, in permafrost regions, soil moisture is highly heterogeneous and difficult to model. Satellite soil moisture data may fill this gap, but the degree to which they can improve permafrost modeling is unknown. To explore their added value for modeling soil temperatures, we assimilate fine‐scale satellite surface soil moisture into the CryoGrid‐3 permafrost model, which accounts for the soil moisture's influence on the soil thermal properties and the surface energy balance. At our study site in the Canadian Arctic, the assimilation improves the estimates of deeper (&gt;10 cm) soil temperatures during summer but not consistently those of the near‐surface temperatures. The improvements in the deeper temperatures are strongly contingent on soil type: They are largest for porous organic soils (30%), smaller for thin organic soil covers (20%), and they essentially vanish for mineral soils (only synthetic data available). That the improvements are greatest over organic soils reflects the strong coupling between soil moisture and deeper temperatures. The coupling arises largely from the diminishing soil thermal conductivity with increasing desiccation thanks to which the deeper soil is kept cool. It is this association of dry organic soils being cool at depth that lets the assimilation revise the simulated soil temperatures toward the actually measured ones. In the future, the increasing availability of satellite soil moisture data holds promise for the operational monitoring of soil temperatures, hydrology, and biogeochemistry.</abstract><url hash="d8449639">2019.GWF-1.233</url><doi>10.1029/2018WR023247</doi><bibkey>Zwieback-etal-2019-Improving</bibkey></paper><paper id="234"><title>The Framework of Ecosystem Services for Economic Valuation Purposes: A Review</title><author><first>N.</first><last>M.

We produce return levels of anomalies of daily maximum temperature extremes for an area over Ireland, for the 30‐year period 1981–2010. We employ extreme value theory (EVT) to model the data using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) as part of a three‐level Bayesian hierarchical model. We use predictive processes in order to solve the computationally difficult problem of modeling data over a very dense spatial field. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine predictive processes and EVT in this manner. The model is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Posterior parameter estimates and return level surfaces are produced, in addition to specific site analysis at synoptic stations, including Casement Aerodrome and Dublin Airport. Observational data from the period 2011–2018 are included in this site analysis to determine if there is evidence of a change in the observed extremes. An increase in the frequency of extreme anomalies, but not the severity, is observed for this period. We found that the frequency of observed extreme anomalies from 2011 to 2018 at the Casement Aerodrome and Phoenix Park synoptic stations exceed the upper bounds of the credible intervals from the model by 20% and 7%, respectively.

Melting agricultural snowcovers are patchy, which leads to melt rate enhancement by energy advection from warm moist snow-free surfaces to cool dry snowcovers. Agricultural snowmelt is also impacted by crop residue. Adoption of zero-tillage agricultural practices means vast areas of the Canadian Prairies are now characterized by standing crop stubble. Stubble influences snow accumulation through blowing snow processes and snowmelt through the impact of emerging stubble upon the surface energy balance. Unfortunately, stubble emergence and advection to patchy snowcovers are unaccounted for in snow hydrology models and a complete process description has been unavailable. Here, both advection and stubble influences on snowmelt hydrology are modelled by coupling new stubble-snow-atmosphere surface energy balance and advection models to existing blowing snow and frozen soil infiltration models. Long-term meteorological datasets from sub-humid and semi-arid locations in Saskatchewan, Canada are used to quantify the influence of stubble characteristics on accumulation, melt, and meltwater partitioning processes with respect to interannual variability, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic differences on the Canadian Prairies. The hydrological response to increasing stubble height is increased meltwater, melt rate, infiltration, and runoff, and negligible changes in melt duration. The response of these processes to changes in stubble height was more pronounced at a semi-arid site versus a sub-humid site as stubble more effectively suppresses blowing snow sublimation in the windier, drier semi-arid environment of southwestern Saskatchewan. Recommendations for stubble management to meet specific runoff or infiltration objectives are summarised; stubble management can be an effective tool to influence infiltration where soils are dry and runoff where soils are wet. This framework allows the diagnosis of the influence of stubble management on meltwater partitioning in cold agricultural regions.</abstract><url hash="4f964fb1">2019.GWF-1.238</url><doi>10.1080/07011784.2019.1575774</doi><bibkey>Harder-etal-2019-Implications</bibkey></paper><paper id="239"><title>Microbial community composition of sediments influenced by intensive mariculture activity</title><author><first>Chyrene</first><last>Moncada</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Hassenrück</last></author><author><first>A.</first><last>Gärdes</last></author><author><first>C.</first><last>Conaco</last></author><abstract>&amp;NA; Marine aquaculture is a major industry that supports the economy in many countries, including the Philippines. However, excess feeds and fish waste generated by mariculture activities contribute an immense nutrient load to the environment that can affect the underlying sediment. To better understand these impacts, we compared the physicochemical characteristics and microbial community composition of sediments taken at a fish cage and an off cage site in Bolinao, Philippines. Sediments and pore water at the fish cage site showed evidence of greater organic enrichment relative to the off cage site. Under these conditions, we found lower relative abundance of dissimilatory sulfate reductase and nitrite reductase genes, suggesting shifts in prevalent nutrient cycling processes. This is further supported by 16S rRNA gene sequencing that revealed differences in the community composition between sites. Fish cage sediments favored the growth of taxa that thrive in anaerobic, organic carbon‐enriched environments, such as members of class Anaerolineae, which can potentially serve as bioindicators of eutrophication in sediments. This study demonstrates that intensive mariculture activity can cause eutrophic sediment conditions that influence microbial community structure and function. &amp;NA; Graphical Abstract Figure.

The Interior of Western Canada, up to and including the Arctic, has experienced rapid change in its climate, hydrology, cryosphere and ecosystems and this is expected to continue. Although there is general consensus that warming will occur in the future, many critical issues remain. In this first of two articles, attention is placed on atmospheric-related issues that range from large scales down to individual precipitation events. Each of these is considered in terms of expected change organized by season and utilizing climate scenario information as well as thermodynamically-driven future climatic forcing simulations. Large scale atmospheric circulations affecting this region are generally projected to become stronger in each season and, coupled with warming temperatures, lead to enhancements of numerous water-related and temperature-related extremes. These include winter snowstorms, freezing rain, drought as well as atmospheric forcing of spring floods although not necessarily summer convection. Collective insights of these atmospheric findings are summarized in a consistent, connected physical framework.

However, disturbances that alter land cover are prevalent in Arctic-Boreal ecosystems, and changes in Arctic-Boreal land cover, which complicate interpretation of trends in vegetation indices, have mostly been ignored in previous studies. Here we use a new land cover change dataset derived from Landsat imagery to explore the extent to which land cover and land cover change influence trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over a large (3.76 M km2) area of NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, which spans much of northwestern Canada and Alaska. Between 1984 and 2012, 21.2% of the study domain experienced land cover change and 42.7% had significant NDVI trends. Land cover change occurred in 27.6% of locations with significant NDVI trends during this period and resulted in greening and browning rates 48%–128% higher than in areas of stable land cover. While the majority of land cover change areas experienced significant NDVI trends, more than half of areas with stable land cover did not. Further, the extent and magnitude of browning and greening trends varied substantially as a function of land cover class and land cover change type. Forest disturbance from fire and timber harvest drove over one third of statistically significant NDVI trends and created complex mosaics of recent forest loss (as browning) and post-disturbance recovery (as greening) at both landscape and continental scale. Our results demonstrate the importance of land cover changes in highly disturbed high-latitude ecosystems for interpreting trends of NDVI and productivity across multiple spatial scales.</abstract><url hash="970500fe">2019.GWF-1.243</url><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ab5429</doi><bibkey>A.

Fires can result in dramatic changes to C stocks and can restructure plant and microbial communities, with long-lasting effects on ecosystem functions. We investigated wildfire effects on soil microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in an extreme fire season in the northwestern Canadian boreal forest, using field surveys, remote sensing, and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. We found that fire occurrence, along with vegetation community, moisture regime, pH, total carbon, and soil texture are all significant predictors of soil microbial community composition. Communities become increasingly dissimilar with increasingly severe burns, and the burn severity index (an index of the fractional area of consumed organic soils and exposed mineral soils) best predicted total bacterial community composition, while burned/unburned was the best predictor for fungi. Globally abundant taxa were identified as significant positive fire responders, including the bacteria Massilia sp. (64× more abundant with fire) and Arthrobacter sp. (35×), and the fungi Penicillium sp. (22×) and Fusicladium sp. (12×). Bacterial and fungal co-occurrence network modules were characterized by fire responsiveness as well as pH and moisture regime. Building on the efforts of previous studies, our results identify specific fire-responsive microbial taxa and suggest that accounting for burn severity improves our understanding of their response to fires, with potentially important implications for ecosystem function.</abstract><url hash="0961955d">2019.GWF-1.244</url><doi>10.1101/512798</doi><bibkey>Whitman-etal-2019-Soil</bibkey></paper><paper id="245"><title>Plasma Science and Technology: Referee List</title><author><first>M.</first><last>Hafizi</last></author><author><first>Akishev</first><last>Akishev</last></author><author><first>Yuri</first><last>Aldea</last></author><author><first>E.</first><last>Alessandria</last></author><author><first>Panagiotis</first><last>Dinescu</last></author><author><first>G.</first><last>Ding</last></author><author><first>Yongjie</first><last>Ding</last></author><author><first>Zhenfeng</first><last>Dong</last></author><author><first>Jiaqi</first><last>Dong</last></author><author><first>Quanli</first><last>Dong</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyu</first><last>Donoso</last></author><abstract>We are grateful to the following referees for reviewing papers for Plasma Science and Technology from Nov. 19, 2018 to Nov. 19, 2019 Adb Jelil, Radhia Abe, K Ahmad, Mohd Hafizi Akishev, Yuri Aldea, Eugen Alessandria, Valentina Alexey, Panchenko Almaviva, S Ambrico, Paolo F Andre, P Angelone, M Angioni, C Askinazi, L G Assadi, Aymen Amine Atzeni, S Babaeva, Natalia Yu Badziak, J Baig, M A Bao, Jian Baryshevsky, Vladimir Bazhenov, V Y Begum, Mahmuda Bell, Ronald E Beloplotov, Dmitry Benhenni, M Berger, Birk Bhatt, Chet Bian, Xingming Biewer, T M Bilato, R Blajan, Marius Bohm, P Borcia, C Borcia, Gabriela Borghi, C A Bormashenko, Edward Bouchikhi, Abdelaziz Bousquet, A Boxman, R Brantov, A V Brezinsek, S Briefi, Stefan Brust, Henrike Bundaleska, N Burgos, Munoz J M Cai, Hongtao Cai, Huishan Cai, Xinjing Cairns, R A Cannas, B Cao, Lihua Cao, Wenbin Cao, Yong Castro, Giuseppe Caughman, John B O Cazacu, Georgeta Celik, Murat Cenian, A Cerri, G Chang, D H Chatterjee, Prasanta Chen, Bingyan Chen, Fu Chen, Guangliang Chen, Hui Chen, Liming Chen, Min Chen, Ming Chen, Mingli Chen, Ping Chen, Qiang Chen, She Chen, Zhaoquan Chen, Zhaoyang Chen, Zhi Cheng, Cheng Cheng, Jun Cheng, Zhifeng Choquet, Isabelle Chrystal, C Clement, F Cohen, Morris B Conde, L Conversano, Ryan Cressault, Y Cristina, Maria Cristofolini, Andrea Cross, Adrian Cruz, Nilson C Cui, Zhifeng Cwikowski, Oliver Czylkowski, Dariusz Dai, Dong Dai, Shuyu Deepak, G Divya DeLucia, F C Demidiouk, V Demidov, V I Denysenko, I B Di, Lanbo Dimitrakellis, Panagiotis Dinescu, G Ding, Yongjie Ding, Zhenfeng Dong, Jiaqi Dong, Quanli Dong, Xiaoyu Donoso, Jose Dors, Miroslaw Du, Boxue Du, Chengran Du, Jiulin Duan, C L Duan, Ping Dujko, Sasa Durodie, F Eich, T El-Shewy, E El-Taibany, W F El-Tantawy, Samir Evans, Todd Fan, Weili Fan, Yuwei Fang, Zhi Fauchais, P Favre, M Fazekas, Péter Feng, Jingwei Feng, Kaiming Feng, Y Feng, Yan Fitzpatrick, R Flege, S Franzke, Joachim Fredriksen, Ashild Fu, Haiyang Fu, Yangyang Fu, Yuwei Funaki, I Furno, Ivo Galata, A Gamaleev, Vladislav Gao, Li Gao, Xiang Gao, Yuan Gao, Zhe Ghai, Yashika Ghashghaee, Mohammad Ghosh, Soumen Giacomelli, Luca Godyak, V A Goebel, Dan M Gong, Renxi Gong, Xueyu Goodman, T P Grach, Savely Green, David L Gric, Tatjana Grierson, B A Gryaznevich, Mikhail Gu, Xiaowei Gudmundsson, Jon Tomas Guo, Fan Guo, Houyang Guo, Li Guo, Shimin Gupta, D N Gurel, C S Gusakov, E Z Gyergyek, T Hafez, Md.
