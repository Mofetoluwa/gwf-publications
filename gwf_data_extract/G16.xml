With a versatile and expandable data schema, it is initially designed to host and match the following documents and data for each trial: registry entries; links, abstracts, or texts of academic journal papers; portions of regulatory documents describing individual trials; structured data on methods and results extracted by systematic reviewers or other researchers; clinical study reports; and additional documents such as blank consent forms, blank case report forms, and protocols. The intention is to create an open, freely re-usable index of all such information and to increase discoverability, facilitate research, identify inconsistent data, enable audits on the availability and completeness of this information, support advocacy for better data and drive up standards around open data in evidence-based medicine. The project has phase I funding. This will allow us to create a practical data schema and populate the database initially through web-scraping, basic record linkage techniques, crowd-sourced curation around selected drug areas, and import of existing sources of structured and documents. It will also allow us to create user-friendly web interfaces onto the data and conduct user engagement workshops to optimise the database and interface designs. Where other projects have set out to manually and perfectly curate a narrow range of information on a smaller number of trials, we aim to use a broader range of techniques and attempt to match a very large quantity of information on all trials. We are currently seeking feedback and additional sources of structured data.</abstract><url hash="4178f9e3">G16-1001</url><doi>10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8</doi><bibkey>Goldacre-2016-OpenTrials:</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="2"><meta><booktitle>Ecosphere, Volume 7, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2016</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Response of understory vegetation to salvage logging following a high‐severity wildfire</title><author><first>Eric E.</first><last>Knapp</last></author><author><first>Martin W.</first><last>Ritchie</last></author><abstract>Timber is frequently salvage-logged following high-severity stand-replacing wildfire, but the practice is controversial. One concern is that compound disturbances could result in more deleterious impacts than either disturbance individually, with mechanical operations having the potential to set back recovering native species and increase invasion by non-native species. Following the 2002 Cone Fire on the Lassen National Forest, three replicates of five salvage treatments were applied to 15 units formerly dominated by ponderosa pine, covering a range of disturbance intensities from unsalvaged to 100% salvaged. Understory species richness and cover data were collected every two years between 2006 and 2012. Richness of both native and non-native species did not differ among salvage treatments, but both showed strong changes over time. While cover of forbs and graminoids did not differ with salvage treatment, cover of shrubs was significantly reduced at the higher salvage intensities. The three main shrub species are all stimulated to germinate by fire, potentially leaving seedlings vulnerable to any mechanical disturbance occurring immediately postgermination. Many other native perennial species emerge from rhizomes or other deeply buried underground structures and appear to be less affected by salvage harvest. Over time, the plant community in all salvage treatments shifted from dominance by shrubs and forbs to shrubs and grasses. Most of the grasses were native, except Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), which was found in 4% of measurement quadrats in 2006 and 52% in 2012. Our results indicated that understory vegetation change 4–10 years posthigh-severity wildfire appeared to be influenced more strongly by factors other than salvage logging.</abstract><url hash="53cd560d">G16-2001</url><doi>10.1002/ecs2.1550</doi><bibkey>Knapp-2016-Response</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="3"><meta><booktitle>Water Resources Research, Volume 52, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2016</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The fan of influence of streams and channel feedbacks to simulated land surface water and carbon dynamics</title><author><first>Chaopeng</first><last>Shen</last></author><author><first>William J.</first><last>Riley</last></author><author><first>Kurt R.</first><last>Smithgall</last></author><author><first>John M.</first><last>Melack</last></author><author><first>Kuai</first><last>Fang</last></author><abstract>Author(s): Shen, C; Riley, WJ; Smithgall, KR; Melack, JM; Fang, K | Abstract: Large-scale land models assume unidirectional land-to-river hydrological interactions, without considering feedbacks between channels and land. Using a tested, physically based model with explicit multiway interactions between overland, channel, wetland, and groundwater flows, we assessed how the representation and properties of channels influence simulated land surface hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamics. A zone near the channels where various fluxes and states are significantly influenced by the channels, referred to as the fan of influence (FoI) of channels, has been identified. We elucidated two mechanisms inducing the model-derived FoI: the base flow mechanism, in which incised, gaining streams lower the water table and induce more base flow, and the relatively more efficient conveyance of the channel network compared to overland flow. We systematically varied drainage density and grid resolution to quantify the size of the FoI, which is found to span a large fraction of the watershed (25-50%) for hydrologic variables including depth to water table and recharge, etc. The FoI is more pronounced with low-resolution simulations but remains noticeable in hyperresolution (25 m) subbasin simulations. The FoI and the channel influence on basin-average fluxes are also similar in simulations with alternative parameter sets. We found that high-order, entrenched streams cause larger FoI. In addition, removing the simulated channels has disproportionally large influence on modeled wetland areas and inundation duration, which has implications for coupled biogeochemical or ecological modeling. Our results suggest that explicit channel representation provides important feedbacks to land surface dynamics which should be considered in meso or large-scale simulations. Since grid refinement incurs prohibitive computational cost, subgrid channel parameterization has advantages in efficiency over grid-based representations that do not distinguish between overland flow and channel flow.</abstract><url hash="eb713168">G16-3001</url><pages>880-902</pages><doi>10.1002/2015wr018086</doi><bibkey>Shen-2016-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="4"><meta><booktitle>Climate Dynamics, Volume 48, Issue 7-8</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2016</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Future changes to drought characteristics over the Canadian Prairie Provinces based on NARCCAP multi-RCM ensemble</title><author><first>M.

S.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><abstract>The significance of spatial variability of rainfall on runoff is explored as a function of catchment scale and type, and antecedent conditions via the continuous time, semi-distributed probability distributed model (PDM) hydrological model applied to the Upper Lee catchment, UK. The impact of catchment scale and type is assessed using 11 nested catchments, and further assessed by artificially changing the catchment characteristics and translating these to model parameters (MPs) with uncertainty using model regionalisation. Dry and wet antecedent conditions are represented by ‘warming up’ the model under different rainfall time series. Synthetic rainfall events are introduced to directly relate the change in simulated runoff to the spatial variability of rainfall. Results show that runoff volume and peak are more sensitive to the spatial rainfall for more impermeable catchments; however, this sensitivity is significantly undermined under wet antecedent conditions. Although there is indication that the impact of spatial rainfall on runoff varies as a function of catchment scale, the variability of antecedent conditions between the synthetic catchments seems to mask this significance. Parameter uncertainty analysis highlights the importance of accurately representing the spatial variability of the catchment properties and their translation to MPs when investigating the effects of spatial properties of rainfall on runoff.</abstract><url hash="dcafc15a">G16-6001</url><pages>1118-1130</pages><doi>10.2166/nh.2016.038</doi><bibkey>Pechlivanidis-2016-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="7"><meta><booktitle>Ecosystems, Volume 20, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2016</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Losing Legacies, Ecological Release, and Transient Responses: Key Challenges for the Future of Northern Ecosystem Science</title><author><first>Merritt R.</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>Jill F.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>Michelle C.</first><last>Mack</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>McCann</last></author><author><first>Edward A.

Due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, water quality models have been increasingly applied to catchments as Decision Support Tools (DSTs) to identify mitigation options that can be introduced to reduce agricultural diffuse water pollution and improve water quality. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the River Wensum catchment in eastern England with the aim of quantifying the long-term impacts of potential changes to agricultural management practices on river water quality. Calibration and validation were successfully performed at a daily time-step against observations of discharge, nitrate and total phosphorus obtained from high-frequency water quality monitoring within the Blackwater sub-catchment, covering an area of 19.6 km(2). A variety of mitigation options were identified and modelled, both singly and in combination, and their long-term effects on nitrate and total phosphorus losses were quantified together with the 95% uncertainty range of model predictions. Results showed that introducing a red clover cover crop to the crop rotation scheme applied within the catchment reduced nitrate losses by 19.6%. Buffer strips of 2 m and 6 m width represented the most effective options to reduce total phosphorus losses, achieving reductions of 12.2% and 16.9%, respectively. This is one of the first studies to quantify the impacts of agricultural mitigation options on long-term water quality for nitrate and total phosphorus at a daily resolution, in addition to providing an estimate of the uncertainties of those impacts. The results highlighted the need to consider multiple pollutants, the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions and the risk of unintended pollutant impacts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation options, and showed that high-frequency water quality datasets can be applied to robustly calibrate water quality models, creating DSTs that are more effective and reliable.</abstract><url hash="3c70b669">G16-8001</url><pages>147-163</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.05.002</doi><bibkey>Taylor-2016-Modelling</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="9"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), Volume 6, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science</publisher><address /><year>2016</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Cooling on Photovoltaic Panel Using Forced Air Convection Induced by DC Fan</title><author><first>A.R.</first><last>Amelia</last></author><author><first>Y.M.</first><last>Irwan</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Irwanto</last></author><author><first>W.Z.</first><last>Leow</last></author><author><first>N.</first><last>Gomesh</last></author><author><first>I.</first><last>Safwati</last></author><author><first>M.A.M.</first><last>Anuar</last></author><abstract>&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Photovoltaic (PV) panel is the heart of solar system generally has a low energy conversion efficiency available in the market. PV panel temperature control is the main key to keeping the PV panel operate efficiently. This paper presented the great influenced of the cooling system in reduced PV panel temperature. A cooling system has been developed based on forced convection induced by DC fan as cooling mechanism. DC fan was attached at the back side of PV panel will extract the heat energy distributed and cool down the PV panel. The working operation of DC fan controlled by PIC18F4550 microcontroller which depending on the average value of PV panel temperature. Experiments were performed with and without cooling mechanism attached at the backside PV panel. The whole PV system was subsequently evaluated in outdoor weather conditions. As a result, it is concluded that there is an optimum number of DC fans required as cooling mechanism in producing efficient electrical output from a PV panel. The study clearly shows how cooling mechanism improves the performance of PV panel at the hot climatic weather. In short, the reduction of PV panel temperature is very important to keep its performance operated efficiently.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</abstract><url hash="84ccd10c">G16-9001</url><pages>526</pages><doi>10.11591/ijece.v6i2.pp526-534</doi><bibkey>Amelia-2016-Cooling</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
