The paper argues that it will not only remain important, but that its importance will continue to grow. This argument is partly based on the `law' of tendency to executability, which the paper introduces. The paper also makes a case for Source Code Analysis purely for the sake of analysis. Analysis for its own sake may not be merely indulgent introspection. The paper argues that it may ultimately prove to be hugely important as source code gradually gathers together all aspects of human socioeconomic and governmental processes and systems. The paper is a written to accompany the author's keynote presentation at the 10th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2010). As such, the body of the paper adopts a polemic, first person singular prose style and takes the form of an extended position paper.</abstract><url hash="97211afe">G10-1001</url><doi>10.1109/scam.2010.28</doi><bibkey>Harman-2010-Why</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
