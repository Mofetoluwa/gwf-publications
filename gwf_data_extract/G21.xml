Consequently, inconsistencies arise between WUE calculations due to complex physical and physiological interactions. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare WUE estimates (harvest or flux-based) for alfalfa (C3 plant) and maize (C4 plant) and determine effects of input variables, plant physiology and farming practices on estimates. Four WUE calculations were investigated: two “harvest-based” methods, using above ground carbon content and either precipitation or evapotranspiration (ET), and two “flux-based” methods, using gross primary productivity (GPP) and either ET or transpiration. WUE estimates differed based on method used at both half-hourly and seasonal scales. Input variables used in calculations affected WUE estimates, and plant physiology led to different responses in carbon assimilation and water use variables. WUE estimates were also impacted by different plant physiological responses and processing methods, even when the same carbon assimilation and water use variables were considered. This study highlights a need to develop a metric of measuring cropland carbon-water coupling that accounts for all water use components, plant carbon responses, and biomass production.</abstract><url hash="6d95d3c6">G21-1001</url><pages>739</pages><doi>10.3390/agriculture11080739</doi><bibkey>De Haan-2021-Assessment</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="2"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Soil and Water Conservation</booktitle><publisher>Soil and Water Conservation Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Temporal variability in water and nutrient movement through vertisols into agricultural tile drains in the northern Great Plains</title><author><first>V.</first><last>Kokulan</last></author><author><first>M.L.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>G.A.</first><last>Ali</last></author><author><first>D.A.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Morison</last></author><author><first>B.C.</first><last>Brooks</last></author><abstract>Agricultural tile drainage is expanding in the northern Great Plains of North America. Given ongoing environmental and political concerns related to the eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg in Canada and the potential for tile drains to transport significant quantities of nutrients from agricultural fields, an improved understanding of nutrient dynamics in tile drains in this region is needed. This study characterized seasonal patterns in tile flow and chemistry under variable hydroclimatic conditions and related this variance to temporal variability in soil hydraulic properties in a farm in southern Manitoba, Canada, from 2015 to 2017. Tile flow, soil hydraulic properties, and groundwater table position all varied seasonally, as did the chemistry of tile drain effluent. The majority of annual tile discharge, which occurred in late spring, appears to have been contributed by shallow groundwater, primarily through soil matrix pathways. At these greater tile flow rates, concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) were low (&amp;lt;0.03 mg L&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; SRP, &amp;lt;0.04 mg L&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; TP), but concentrations of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N) were high (20 to 25 mg L&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N). In contrast, tile flows outside of this peak period appeared to be primarily attributed to preferential flow pathways through frozen (snowmelt) and dry soil cracks (summer). Phosphorus (P) concentrations were greater during snowmelt and summer (~0.05 mg L&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; SRP, ~0.1 mg L&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; TP) but did not produce significant nutrient loads due to the minimal tile discharge rates (&amp;lt;1 mm d&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work suggests that the expansion of tile drainage may not exacerbate water quality issues involving P in the northern Great Plains but may increase nitrogen (N) loads in local water bodies.</abstract><url hash="7f207c28">G21-2001</url><pages>00099</pages><doi>10.2489/jswc.2021.00099</doi><bibkey>Kokulan-2021-Temporal</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="3"><meta><booktitle>Data in Brief, Volume 38</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Phosphorus runoff from Canadian agricultural land: A dataset for 30 experimental fields</title><author><first>Jian</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Jane A.</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>Henry F.</first><last>Wilson</last></author><author><first>Merrin L.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>Helen M.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>David A.</first><last>Lobb</last></author><abstract>Phosphorus (P) runoff from agricultural land plays a critical role in downstream water quality.

Although P loss from arable land is a critical contributor to P loads in many agricultural watersheds , there has been a lack of understanding of P loss patterns and drivers across regions. Here, we synthesized edge-of-field P and sediment runoff data for 30 arable fields in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario (a total of 216 site-years) to elucidate spatial and temporal differences in runoff and P mobilization in snowmelt and rainfall runoff, and discuss climatic, soil and management drivers for these patterns. Across all regions, precipitation inputs were positively correlated with runoff amounts and consequently P loads. Runoff and P losses were dominated by snowmelt across all sites, however, regional differences in runoff amounts, and P concentrations, loads and speciation were apparent. Proportions of total P in the dissolved form were greater in the prairie region (55–94% in Manitoba) than in the Great Lakes region (26–35% in Ontario). In Manitoba, dissolved P concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated to soil Olsen P concentrations in the 0–5 cm soil depth; however, this relationship was not found for Ontario fields, where tile drainage dominated hydrologic losses. Although precipitation amounts and runoff volumes were greater in Ontario than Manitoba, some of the greatest P loads were observed from Manitoba fields, driven by management practices. This synthesis highlights the differences across the Canadian agricultural regions in P runoff patterns and drivers, and suggests the need of co-ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management. Phosphorus runoff patterns vary with climatic regions across Canada. †The dissolved P was measured as total dissolved P in MB and dissolved reactive P in SK and ON. ‡Total P was not measured in SK. • Phosphorus runoff patterns and drivers vary with climatic regions across Canada. • Co-ordinated and standardized monitoring programs are key to clarify regional differences. • Snowmelt dominates runoff volume and phosphorus loss across Canada. • The predominant form of P in runoff differs between the Prairie region and the Great Lakes region. • Reducing phosphorus sources is important for mitigating phosphorus runoff.</abstract><url hash="5a4b23f4">G21-4001</url><pages>107030</pages><doi>10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107030</doi><bibkey>Liu-Elliott-2021-Phosphorus-runoff</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="5"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Environmental Quality, Volume 50, Issue 3</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>One size does not fit all: Toward regional conservation practice guidance to reduce phosphorus loss risk in the Lake Erie watershed</title><author><first>Merrin</first><last>Macrae</last></author><author><first>Helen</first><last>Jarvie</last></author><author><first>Roy</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Gunn</last></author><author><first>Keith</first><last>Reid</last></author><author><first>Pam</first><last>Joosse</last></author><author><first>Kevin</first><last>King</last></author><author><first>Peter</first><last>Kleinman</last></author><author><first>Doug</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Mark</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>Martha</first><last>Zwonitzer</last></author><abstract>Agricultural phosphorus (P) losses to surface water bodies remain a global eutrophication concern, despite the application of conservation practices on farm fields. Although it is generally agreed upon that the use of multiple conservation practices (“stacking”) will lead to greater improvements to water quality, this may not be cost effective to farmers, reducing the likelihood of adoption. At present, wholesale recommendations of conservation practices are given; however, the application of specific conservation practices in certain environments (e.g., no-till with surface application, cover crops) may not be effective and can even lead to unintended consequences. In this paper, we present the Lake Erie watershed as a case study. The Lake Erie watershed contains regions with unique physical geographies that include differences in climate, soil, topography, and land use, which have implications for both P transport from agricultural fields and the efficacy of conservation practices in mitigating P losses. We define major regions within the Lake Erie watershed where common strategies for conservation practice implementation are appropriate, and we propose a five-step plan for bringing regionally tailored, adaptive, and cost-conscious conservation practice into watershed planning. Although this paper is specific to the Lake Erie watershed, our framework can be transferred across broader geographic regions to provide guidance for watershed planning.</abstract><url hash="e2f74491">G21-5001</url><pages>529-546</pages><doi>10.1002/jeq2.20218</doi><bibkey>Macrae-2021-One</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="6"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Great Lakes Research, Volume 47, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Contribution of bunker silo effluent discharged via a riparian zone to watershed phosphorus loads</title><author><first>Dylan W.</first><last>Price</last></author><author><first>Janina M.</first><last>Plach</last></author><author><first>Helen P.</first><last>Jarvie</last></author><author><first>Merrin L.</first><last>Macrae</last></author><abstract>Nutrient losses from agricultural operations are a major contributor to the eutrophication of freshwaters. Although many studies have quantified diffuse nutrient losses, less is known about agricultural point-source contributions, such as bunker silos, to watershed phosphorus (P) loads. This study examined the contributions of a dairy farm bunker silo effluent to watershed soluble reactive P (SRP) and total P (TP) losses. The bunker silo effluent discharged to an adjacent stream via a riparian soakaway for ca. 15 years. Prior to the annual refilling of the bunker silo, flow weighted mean concentrations of SRP (TP) were similar between stream locations up and downstream of the farm. After the bunker silo was refilled, flow-weighted SRP (TP) concentrations in the stream increased by factors of 1.5(2.2) during events and 3.1(2.3) during baseflow. Higher P concentrations occurred in the riparian soils receiving bunker silo effluent (525–3125 mg/kg TP, and 0.1–9.9 mg/kg water extractable P (WEP), compared with 525–939 mg/kg TP, and 0.11–1.43 mg/kg WEP on the opposite side of the stream with no bunker silo effluent. Riparian soils impacted by the bunker silo were near P-saturation, and the riparian zone did little to reduce P transfer in shallow groundwater. The net contributions of bunker silo effluent to annual watershed P losses were 32% (SRP) and 22% (TP). This study highlights the importance of agricultural point sources, and the need to quantify their contributions to watershed P budgets to target P remediation effectively.</abstract><url hash="f042eb7f">G21-6001</url><pages>1296-1304</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jglr.2021.08.004</doi><bibkey>Price-2021-Contribution</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="7"><meta><booktitle>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, Volume 147, Issue 741</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Modelled changes in selected agroclimatic indices over the croplands of western

Peatland disturbances can disrupt the ecohydrological functions that sustain net carbon sequestration in peatlands. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as peatland drainage and harvesting, are often followed by peatland restoration that aims to return the carbon sink function. This is typically achieved by raising the water table and re-establishing keystone Sphagnum moss species. However, with an increasingly uncertain climate and intensifying land-use changes, the potential for multiple disturbances (such as co-occurring wildfires, drainage, and harvesting) to disrupt the ecohydrological feedbacks that support peatland function is increasing. Yet, few studies investigate the ecohydrological trade-offs induced by multiple disturbances in peatlands. To elucidate the complexities of multiple disturbances and restoration on Sphagnum re-establishment and wildfire potential, we studied a Deep and Shallow harvested area in a drained and restored peatland in southern Ontario, Canada that experienced a wildfire in 2012. Harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat, but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the depth of burn (DOB) due to the more varied remnant topography. The difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased peat carbon losses (16.5 kg C m −2 ) from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area (15.1 kg C m −2 ). The difference in post-fire peat hydrophysical properties of the Deep and Shallow harvest area drove divergent soil water conditions. In the post-burn peat, the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of Sphagnum mosses was more prevalent at the Shallow harvest areas but the higher soil water retention capabilities of the Deep harvest peat lowered the risk of subsequent peat ignition. This study highlights the complex interactions multiple disturbances have on peatland ecohydrology and that we urgently need to understand these interactions to better manage our shared peatland resources in an increasingly uncertain future.</abstract><url hash="109d9c4c">G21-8001</url><pages>126793</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126793</doi><bibkey>McCarter-2021-Ecohydrological</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Sensitivity analysis of hydrological processes to perturbed climate in a southern boreal forest basin</title><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>He</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Xing</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>Amber</first><last>Peterson</last></author><abstract>• The CRHM-created Boreal Hydrology Model performed quite well on simultaneously simulating runoff, snow water equivalent, soil liquid water content and evapotranspiration (ET) with minor parameter calibration. • The basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of precipitation (P) and temperature (T). Annual runoff was more sensitive to rising P than warming T, but annual ET was more sensitive to warming T. • Perturbed P and T had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime. Increased P enhanced the intra- and inter-annual variabilities of basin runoff, whilst rising T resulted in the inverse changes. • Effects of warming on annual runoff and snow processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in P. Hydrological processes over and through frozen and unfrozen ground were simulated in the well instrumented boreal forest basin of White Gull Creek, Saskatchewan, Canada using a model created using the flexible Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform. The CRHM-created Boreal Hydrology Model was structured and initially parameterized using decades of process hydrology research in the southern boreal forest with minor parameter calibration, and generally produced quite good performance on simultaneously reproducing the measurements of runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil liquid water content and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration (ET) over two decades. To examine the sensitivity of basin hydrology to perturbed climate inputs, air temperature (T) inputs were set up by linear increments in the reference observation of up to +6 ℃, and precipitation (P) inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed P from 70% to 130%. The model results showed that the basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of P and T. The volume of annual runoff and the annual runoff coefficient increased more rapidly with rising P, at rates of 31% and 16% per 10% increase in P, but decreased by only 3.8% and 4.7% per 1 ℃ of warming. Annual ET increased rapidly with temperature, by 7% per 1 ℃ of warming and therefore drove the streamflow volumetric changes with warming, but increased only 1% per 10% increase in P. Perturbations of P and T had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime. Increased P enhanced the intra- and inter-annual variabilities of basin runoff, reduced the relative contribution of winter runoff to annual runoff and increased the relative contribution of summer runoff; whilst rising T resulted in the inverse changes in the streamflow regime. Effects of warming on some hydrological processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in P. Reductions in the annual runoff volume and runoff coefficient caused by warming up to 6 ℃ could be compensated for by increases of &lt;20% in P. However, the maximum increase in P (+30%) examined could only compensate for the changes in snow processes caused by warming of less than 4 ℃ and snow-cover duration decreases with 1 ℃ warming could not be compensated for by any precipitation increase considered. These results inform the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the first-order changes in P and T and provide guidance for further climate impact assessments for hydrology in the southern boreal forest in Canada.</abstract><url hash="8994cdf6">G21-8002</url><pages>126706</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126706</doi><bibkey>He-2021-Sensitivity</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="9"><meta><booktitle>Hydrological Processes, Volume 35, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Scientists' warning on extreme wildfire risks to water supply</title><author><first>François‐Nicolas</first><last>Robinne</last></author><author><first>Dennis W.</first><last>Hallema</last></author><author><first>Kevin D.</first><last>Bladon</last></author><author><first>Mike D.</first><last>Flannigan</last></author><author><first>Gabrielle</first><last>Boisramé</last></author><author><first>Christian M.</first><last>Bréthaut</last></author><author><first>Stefan H.</first><last>Doerr</last></author><author><first>Giuliano</first><last>Di Baldassarre</last></author><author><first>Louise A.</first><last>Gallagher</last></author><author><first>Amanda K.</first><last>Hohner</last></author><author><first>Stuart J.</first><last>Khan</last></author><author><first>Alicia M.</first><last>Kinoshita</last></author><author><first>Rua</first><last>Mordecai</last></author><author><first>João Pedro</first><last>Nunes</last></author><author><first>Petter</first><last>Nyman</last></author><author><first>Cristina</first><last>Santín</last></author><author><first>Gary</first><last>Sheridan</last></author><author><first>Cathelijne R.</first><last>Stoof</last></author><author><first>Matthew P.</first><last>Thompson</last></author><author><first>James M.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><author><first>Yu</first><last>Wei</last></author><abstract>2020 is the year of wildfire records. California experienced its three largest fires early in its fire season. The Pantanal, the largest wetland on the planet, burned over 20% of its surface. More than 18 million hectares of forest and bushland burned during the 2019–2020 fire season in Australia, killing 33 people, destroying nearly 2500 homes, and endangering many endemic species. The direct cost of damages is being counted in dozens of billion dollars, but the indirect costs on water-related ecosystem services and benefits could be equally expensive, with impacts lasting for decades. In Australia, the extreme precipitation (“200 mm day −1 in several location”) that interrupted the catastrophic wildfire season triggered a series of watershed effects from headwaters to areas downstream. The increased runoff and erosion from burned areas disrupted water supplies in several locations. These post-fire watershed hazards via source water contamination, flash floods, and mudslides can represent substantial, systemic long-term risks to drinking water production, aquatic life, and socio-economic activity. Scenarios similar to the recent event in Australia are now predicted to unfold in the Western USA. This is a new reality that societies will have to live with as uncharted fire activity, water crises, and widespread human footprint collide all-around of the world. Therefore, we advocate for a more proactive approach to wildfire-watershed risk governance in an effort to advance and protect water security. We also argue that there is no easy solution to reducing this risk and that investments in both green (i.e., natural) and grey (i.e., built) infrastructure will be necessary. Further, we propose strategies to combine modern data analytics with existing tools for use by water and land managers worldwide to leverage several decades worth of data and knowledge on post-fire hydrology.</abstract><url hash="a821fb29">G21-9001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14086</doi><bibkey>Robinne-2021-Scientists'</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Subalpine forest water use behaviour and evapotranspiration during two hydrologically contrasting growing seasons in the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>Lindsey E.</first><last>Langs</last></author><author><first>Richard M.</first><last>Petrone</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Hydrological processes in mountain headwater basins are changing as climate and vegetation change. Interactions between hydrological processes and subalpine forest ecological function are important to mountain water supplies due to their control on evapotranspiration (ET). Improved understanding of the sensitivity of these interactions to seasonal and interannual changes in snowmelt and summer rainfall is needed as these interactions can impact forest growth, succession, health, and susceptibility to wildfire. To better understand this sensitivity, this research examined ET for a sub-alpine forest in the Canadian Rockies over two contrasting growing seasons and quantified the contribution of transpiration (T) from the younger tree population to overall stand ET. The younger population was focused on to permit examination of trees that have grown under the effect of recent climate change and will contribute to treeline migration, and subalpine forest densification and succession. Research sites were located at Fortress Mountain Research Basin, Kananaskis, Alberta, where the subalpine forest examined is composed of Abies lasiocarpa (Subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce). Seasonal changes in water availability from snowmelt, precipitation, soil moisture reserves yielded stark differences in T and ET between 2016 and 2017. ET was higher in the drier year (2017), which had late snowmelt and lower summer rainfall than in the wetter year (2016) that had lower snowmelt and a rainy summer, highlighting the importance of spring snowmelt recharge of soil moisture. However, stand T of the younger trees (73% of forest population) was greater (64 mm) in 2016 (275 mm summer rainfall) than 2017 (39 mm T, 147 mm summer rainfall), and appears to be sensitive to soil moisture decreases in fall, which are largely a function of summer period rainfall. Relationships between subalpine forest water use and different growing season and antecedent (snowmelt period) hydrological conditions clarify the interactions between forest water use and alpine hydrology, which can lead to better anticipation of the hydrological response of subalpine forest-dominated basins to climate variability and change.</abstract><url hash="3128aa93">G21-9002</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14158</doi><bibkey>Langs-2021-Subalpine</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="10"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Wildland Fire, Volume 30, Issue 7</booktitle><publisher>CSIRO Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Mapping smouldering fire potential in boreal peatlands and assessing interactions with the wildland–human interface in Alberta, Canada</title><author><first>S.

The lack of smouldering fire risk assessment is a critical research gap as these fires can represent heavy resource draws and are predominant sources of smoke, air pollutants and atmospheric carbon. Here, for the first time, we combine existing knowledge of the controls on smouldering peat fire with expert opinion-based weightings through a multi-criteria decision analysis, to map the smouldering fire potential (i.e. hazard) of treed peatlands in the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada. We find that smouldering potential varies considerably between treed peatlands and that areas of sparser peatland coverage may contain high smouldering-potential peatlands. Further, we find that treed peatlands are a common feature in the wildland–human interface and that proportionally, the area of high smouldering potential is greater closer to roads compared with farther away. Our approach enables a quantitative measure of smouldering fire potential and evidences the need to incorporate peatland–wildfire interactions into wildfire management operations. We suggest that similar frameworks could be used in other peatland dominated regions as part of smouldering fire risk assessments.</abstract><url hash="e8ad2ca0">G21-10001</url><pages>552</pages><doi>10.1071/wf21001</doi><bibkey>Wilkinson-2021-Mapping</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="11"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Child and Adolescent Resilience, Volume 8, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Canada Research Chair in Interpersonal Traumas and Resilience</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Use of Mobile Applications to Support Indigenous Youth Wellbeing in Canada</title><author><first>Noella</first><last>Noronha</last></author><author><first>Savanah J.</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Dawn</first><last>Martin Hill</last></author><author><first>Lori</first><last>Davis Hill</last></author><author><first>Sara</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Amy</first><last>General</last></author><author><first>Cynthia</first><last>McQueen</last></author><author><first>Makaśa</first><last>Looking Horse</last></author><author><first>Alexander</first><last>Drossos</last></author><author><first>Cynthia</first><last>Lokker</last></author><author><first>Nicole M.</first><last>Bilodeau</last></author><author><first>Christine</first><last>Wekerle</last></author><abstract>In Canada, Indigenous youth have remained resilient despite being confronted with a wide range of structural and systemic risks, such as long-lasting boil water advisories, over-representation in the child welfare system, and injustices related to land treaties. As people of the land, all disruptions to ecological health are a disruption to personal and community holistic health. Land-based activities and cultural continuity strengthen pathways of perseverance for Indigenous youth (Toombs et al., 2016). For youth, cultural self-expression and personal agency are enhanced with digital platforms, which are well-suited to Indigenous people’s strengths in art, music, and oral forms of passing on knowledge. The field of mental health has turned to e-supports such as mobile applications (apps) that can provide easy-to-access intervention, when needed. To date, resilience interventions have received comparatively less attention than the study of resilience factors and processes. It is timely to review the extant literature on mental health apps with Indigenous youth as, currently, Indigenous apps are in early research stages. Critically reviewing work to date, it is argued that an inclusive and expansive concept of resilience, coherent with Indigenous holistic health views, is well-positioned as a foundation for collaborative resilience app development. To date, few mental health apps have been researched with Indigenous youth, and fewer have been co-constructed with Indigenous youth and their community members. The current literature points to feasibility in terms of readiness or potential usage, and functionality for promoting an integrated cultural and holistic health lens. As this effort may be specific to a particular Indigenous nation’s values, stories, and practices, we highlight the Haudenosaunee conceptual wellness model as one example to guide Indigenous and non-Indigenous science integration, with a current project underway with the JoyPopTM mHealth app for promoting positive mental health and resilience.</abstract><url hash="50114bc5">G21-11001</url><doi>10.7202/1077724ar</doi><bibkey>Noronha-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="12"><meta><booktitle>Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Volume 5, Issue EICS</booktitle><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Designing for Recommending Intermediate States in A Scientific Workflow Management System</title><author><first>Debasish</first><last>Chakroborti</last></author><author><first>Banani</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Sristy Sumana</first><last>Nath</last></author><abstract>To process a large amount of data sequentially and systematically, proper management of workflow components (i.e., modules, data, configurations, associations among ports and links) in a Scientific Workflow Management System (SWfMS) is inevitable. Managing data with provenance in a SWfMS to support reusability of workflows, modules, and data is not a simple task. Handling such components is even more burdensome for frequently assembled and executed complex workflows for investigating large datasets with different technologies (i.e., various learning algorithms or models). However, a great many studies propose various techniques and technologies for managing and recommending services in a SWfMS, but only a very few studies consider the management of data in a SWfMS for efficient storing and facilitating workflow executions. Furthermore, there is no study to inquire about the effectiveness and efficiency of such data management in a SWfMS from a user perspective. In this paper, we present and evaluate a GUI version of such a novel approach of intermediate data management with two use cases (Plant Phenotyping and Bioinformatics). The technique we call GUI-RISPTS (Recommending Intermediate States from Pipelines Considering Tool-States) can facilitate executions of workflows with processed data (i.e., intermediate outcomes of modules in a workflow) and can thus reduce the computational time of some modules in a SWfMS. We integrated GUI-RISPTS with an existing workflow management system called SciWorCS. In SciWorCS, we present an interface that users use for selecting the recommendation of intermediate states (i.e., modules' outcomes). We investigated GUI-RISPTS's effectiveness from users' perspectives along with measuring its overhead in terms of storage and efficiency in workflow execution.</abstract><url hash="42a4e42b">G21-12001</url><pages>1-29</pages><doi>10.1145/3457145</doi><bibkey>Chakroborti-2021-Designing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="13"><meta><booktitle>Advances in Visual Computing</booktitle><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Putting Table Cartograms into Practice</title><author><first>Mohammad Rakib</first><last>Hasan</last></author><author><first>Debajyoti</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>Jarin</first><last>Tasnim</last></author><author><first>Kevin A.</first><last>Schneider</last></author><abstract /><url hash="fa18834e">G21-13001</url><pages>91-102</pages><doi>10.1007/978-3-030-90439-5_8</doi><bibkey>Hasan-2021-Putting</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="14"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, Volume 26, Issue 9</booktitle><publisher>American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Project Phase 3: Lake Erie (GRIP-E)</title><author><first>Juliane</first><last>Mai</last></author><author><first>Bryan A.</first><last>Tolson</last></author><author><first>Hongren</first><last>Shen</last></author><author><first>Étienne</first><last>Gaborit</last></author><author><first>Vincent</first><last>Fortin</last></author><author><first>Nicolas</first><last>Gasset</last></author><author><first>Hervé</first><last>Awoye</last></author><author><first>Tricia A.</first><last>Stadnyk</last></author><author><first>Lauren M.</first><last>Fry</last></author><author><first>Emily A.</first><last>Bradley</last></author><author><first>Frank</first><last>Seglenieks</last></author><author><first>André G.

A challenge associated with the use of these models is the computational burden associated with representing the Earth's (sub)surface via millions of computational elements. This burden is exacerbated as more complex process representations are included because their parameterizations involve computationally intensive mathematical functions. Lookup tables (LUTs) approximate a mathematical function by interpolating precomputed values of the function. Highly accurate approximations are possible for substantially reduced computational costs. In this work, a general methodology using the C++ LUT library FunC is applied to identify and replace computationally intensive mathematical function evaluations in the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM). The use of LUTs introduces a pointwise relative error below 10 − 8 and provides a reduction in run time of almost 20%. This work shows how LUTs can be implemented with relatively little pain and yield significant computational savings for distributed hydrological models. • The Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) is profiled and expensive mathematical functions identified. • FunC was used to replace the expensive mathematical functions in CHM with lookup tables. • The run-time performance of CHM was improved by approximately 20% on two realistic simulations. • A general methodology for using FunC to replace expensive mathematical functions with lookup tables is given.</abstract><url hash="cdc6737c">G21-16001</url><pages>105018</pages><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105018</doi><bibkey>Marsh-2021-Performance</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="17"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Modelling &amp;amp; Software, Volume 135</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The proper care and feeding of CAMELS: How limited training data affects streamflow prediction</title><author><first>Martin</first><last>Gauch</last></author><author><first>Juliane</first><last>Mai</last></author><author><first>Jimmy</first><last>Lin</last></author><abstract>Accurate streamflow prediction largely relies on historical meteorological records and streamflow measurements.

In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of tree- and LSTM-based models to limited training data, both in terms of geographic diversity and different time spans. We feed the models meteorological observations disseminated with the CAMELS dataset, and individually restrict the training period length, number of training basins, and input sequence length. We quantify how additional training data improve predictions and how many previous days of forcings we should feed the models to obtain best predictions for each training set size. Further, our findings show that tree- and LSTM-based models provide similarly accurate predictions on small datasets, while LSTMs are superior given more training data.</abstract><url hash="757a1419">G21-17001</url><pages>104926</pages><doi>10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104926</doi><bibkey>Gauch-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="18"><meta><booktitle>Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering</booktitle><publisher>KSI Research Inc.</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>ArchiNet: A Concept-token based Approach for Determining Architectural Change Categories</title><author><first>Amit</first><last>Kumar</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2d19044f">G21-18001</url><doi>10.18293/seke2021-060</doi><bibkey>Kumar-2021-ArchiNet:</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Towards Automatically Generating Release Notes using Extractive Summarization Technique</title><author><first>Sristy</first><last>Sumana</last></author><abstract>Release notes are admitted as an essential document by practitioners.

We propose an automatic generate release notes approach based on the commit messages and merge pull-request (PR) titles to mitigate this problem. We implement one of the popular extractive text summarization techniques, i.e., the TextRank algorithm. However, accurate keyword extraction is a vital issue in text processing. The keyword matching and topic extraction process of the TextRank algorithm ignores the semantic similarity among texts. To improve the keyword extraction method, we integrate the GloVe word embedding technique with TextRank. We develop a dataset with 1,213 release notes (after null filtering) and evaluate the generated release notes through the ROUGE metric and human evaluation. We also compare the performance of our technique with another popular extractive algorithm, latent semantic analysis (LSA).

Development teams aiming to review architectural aspects (design) of a change commit consider many essential scenarios such as access rules and restrictions on usage of program entities across modules. Moreover, design review is essential when proper architectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system. Untangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing design notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support these tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose semantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic slice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules, their classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is easy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming structures (DANS) properties from the source code for developing our tool. Utilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change instances based on our defined metric and then decomposes the slices (based on string processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects (developed in Java and Kotlin) reveals that the DANS properties produce highly reliable precision and recall (93-100%) for detecting and generating architectural slices. Our proposed tool will serve as the preliminary approach for the semantic design recovery and design summary generation for the project releases.</abstract><url hash="95a5632a">G21-19001</url><doi>10.1145/3475716.3484487</doi><bibkey>Mondal-2021-Semantic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="20"><meta><booktitle>Empirical Software Engineering, Volume 26, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>ID-correspondence: a measure for detecting evolutionary coupling</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>Banani</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Chanchal K.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin A.</first><last>Schneider</last></author><abstract /><url hash="af0d5670">G21-20001</url><doi>10.1007/s10664-020-09921-9</doi><bibkey>Mondal-2021-ID-correspondence:</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="21"><meta><booktitle>2021 IEEE/ACM 29th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)</booktitle><publisher>IEEE</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>FLeCCS: A Technique for Suggesting Fragment-Level Similar Co-change Candidates</title><author><first>Manishankar</first><last>Mondal</last></author><author><first>Chanchal K.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Banani</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin A.</first><last>Schneider</last></author><abstract>When a programmer changes a particular code fragment, the other similar code fragments in the code-base may also need to be changed together (i.e., co-changed) consistently to ensure that the software system remains consistent.

However, clone detectors suffer from a confounding configuration choice problem and it affects their accuracy in retrieving co-change candidates.In our research, we propose and empirically evaluate a lightweight co-change suggestion technique that can automatically suggest fragment level similar co-change candidates for a target code fragment using WA-DiSC (Weighted Average Dice-Sørensen Co-efficient) through a context-sensitive mining of the entire code-base.

According to our experiment, our technique outperforms not only the existing code clone based techniques but also the association rule mining based techniques in detecting co-change candidates with a significantly higher accuracy (precision and recall). We also find that File Proximity Ranking performs significantly better than Similarity Extent Ranking when ranking the co-change candidates suggested by our proposed technique.</abstract><url hash="17b13115">G21-21001</url><doi>10.1109/icpc52881.2021.00024</doi><bibkey>Mondal-2021-FLeCCS:</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="22"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, Volume 31, Issue 11n12</booktitle><publisher>World Scientific Pub Co Pte Ltd</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Automatically Generating Release Notes with Content Classification Models</title><author><first>Sristy Sumana</first><last>Nath</last></author><author><first>Banani</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>Release notes are admitted as an essential technical document in software maintenance.

Prior to the digital age, climate records were archived on paper. For example, from the 1950s to the 1990s, solar radiation data from recording stations worldwide were published in booklets by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) Hydrometeorological Service. As a result, the data are not easily accessible by most researchers. The overarching aim of this research is to develop techniques to convert paper-based climate records into a machine-readable format to support environmental research in cold regions. This study compares the performance of a proprietary optical character recognition (OCR) service with an open-source OCR tool for digitizing hydrometeorological data. We built a digitization pipeline combining different image preprocessing techniques, semantic segmentation, and an open-source OCR engine for extracting data and metadata recorded in the scanned documents. Each page contains blocks of text with station names and tables containing the climate data. The process begins with image preprocessing to reduce noise and to improve quality before the page content is segmented to detect tables and finally run through an OCR engine for text extraction. We outline the digitization process and report on initial results, including different segmentation approaches, preprocessing image algorithms, and OCR techniques to ensure accurate extraction and organization of relevant metadata from thousands of scanned climate records. We evaluated the performance of Tesseract OCR and ABBYY FineReader on text extraction. We find that although ABBY FineReader has better accuracy on the sample data, our custom extraction pipeline using Tesseract is efficient and scalable because it is flexible and allows for more customization.</abstract><url hash="bdb8f99e">G21-23001</url><doi>10.1145/3469096.3474929</doi><bibkey>Odunayo-2021-Rescuing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="24"><meta><booktitle>Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies</booktitle><publisher>Springer Singapore</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Large Scale Image Registration Utilizing Data-Tunneling in the MapReduce Cluster</title><author><first>Amit</first><last>Kumar Mondal</last></author><author><first>Banani</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Chanchal K.</first><last>Roy</last></author><author><first>Kevin A.</first><last>Schneider</last></author><abstract>Applications of image registration tasks are computation-intensive, memory-intensive, and communication-intensive. Robust efforts are required on error recovery and re-usability of both the data and the operations, along with performance optimization. Considering these, we explore various programming models aiming to minimize the folding operations (such as join and reduce) which are the primary candidates of data shuffling, concurrency bugs and expensive communication in a distributed cluster. Particularly, we analyze modular MapReduce execution of an image registration pipeline (IRP) with the external and internal data (data-tunneling) flow mechanism and compare them with the compact model. Experimental analyzes with the ComputeCanada cluster and a crop field data-sets containing 1000 images show that these design options are valuable for large-scale IRPs executed with a MapReduce cluster. Additionally, we present an effectiveness measurement metric to analyze the impact of a design model for the Big IRP, accumulating the error-recovery and re-usability metrics along with the data size and execution time. Our explored design models and their performance analysis can serve as a benchmark for the researchers and application developers who deploy large-scale image registration and other image processing tasks.</abstract><url hash="206fc127">G21-24001</url><pages>167-180</pages><doi>10.1007/978-981-16-6636-0_14</doi><bibkey>Kumar Mondal-2021-Large</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="25"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrometeorology</booktitle><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The numerical implementation of land models: Problem formulation and laugh tests</title><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Reza</first><last>Zolfaghari</last></author><author><first>Kevin R.</first><last>Green</last></author><author><first>Sean</first><last>Trim</last></author><author><first>Wouter J.

Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a unified framework to formulate and implement land model equations. We separate the representation of physical processes from their numerical solution, enabling the use of established robust numerical methods to solve the model equations. Second, we introduce a set of synthetic test cases (the laugh tests) to evaluate the numerical implementation of land models. The test cases include storage and transmission of water in soils, lateral sub-surface flow, coupled hydrological and thermodynamic processes in snow, and cryosuction processes in soil. We consider synthetic test cases as “laugh tests” for land models because they provide the most rudimentary test of model capabilities. The laugh tests presented in this paper are all solved with the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives model (SUMMA) implemented using the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/Algebraic equation Solvers (SUNDIALS). The numerical simulations from SUMMA/SUNDIALS are compared against (1) solutions to the synthetic test cases from other models documented in the peer-reviewed literature; (2) analytical solutions; and (3) observations made in laboratory experiments. In all cases, the numerical simulations are similar to the benchmarks, building confidence in the numerical model implementation. We posit that some land models may have difficulty in solving these benchmark problems. Dedicating more effort to solving synthetic test cases is critical in order to build confidence in the numerical implementation of land models.</abstract><url hash="98d3a642">G21-25001</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-20-0175.1</doi><bibkey>Clark-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>The use of serially complete station data to improve the temporal continuity of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates</title><author><first>Guoqiang</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract>Abstract Stations are an important source of meteorological data, but often suffer from missing values and short observation periods. Gap filling is widely used to generate serially complete datasets (SCDs), which are subsequently used to produce gridded meteorological estimates. However, the value of SCDs in spatial interpolation is scarcely studied. Based on our recent efforts to develop a SCD over North America (SCDNA), we explore the extent to which gap filling improves gridded precipitation and temperature estimates. We address two specific questions: (1) Can SCDNA improve the statistical accuracy of gridded estimates in North America? (2) Can SCDNA improve estimates of trends on gridded data? In addressing these questions, we also evaluate the extent to which results depend on the spatial density of the station network and the spatial interpolation methods used. Results show that the improvement in statistical interpolation due to gap filling is more obvious for precipitation, followed by minimum temperature and maximum temperature. The improvement is larger when the station network is sparse and when simpler interpolation methods are used. SCDs can also notably reduce the uncertainties in spatial interpolation. Our evaluation across North America from 1979 to 2018 demonstrates that SCDs improve the accuracy of interpolated estimates for most stations and days. SCDNA-based interpolation also obtains better trend estimation than observation-based interpolation. This occurs because stations used for interpolation could change during a specific period, causing changepoints in interpolated temperature estimates and affect the long-term trends of observation-based interpolation, which can be avoided using SCDNA. Overall, SCDs improve the performance of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates.</abstract><url hash="01daf7f8">G21-25002</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-20-0313.1</doi><bibkey>Tang-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Hydrological evaluation of high-resolution precipitation estimates from the WRF model in the Third Pole river basins</title><author><first>He</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Fengge</first><last>Su</last></author><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>He</last></author><author><first>Tinghai</first><last>Ou</last></author><author><first>Deliang</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Abstract In this study, two sets of precipitation estimates based on the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) –the high Asia refined analysis (HAR) and outputs with a 9 km resolution from WRF (WRF-9km) are evaluated at both basin and point scales, and their potential hydrological utilities are investigated by driving the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) large-scale land surface hydrological model in seven Third Pole (TP) basins. The regional climate model (RCM) tends to overestimate the gauge-based estimates by 20–95% in annual means among the selected basins. Relative to the gauge observations, the RCM precipitation estimates can accurately detect daily precipitation events of varying intensities (with absolute bias &amp;lt; 3 mm). The WRF-9km exhibits a high potential for hydrological application in the monsoon-dominated basins in the southeastern TP (with NSE of 0.7–0.9 and bias of -11% to 3%), while the HAR performs well in the upper Indus (UI) and upper Brahmaputra (UB) basins (with NSE of 0.6 and bias of -15% to -9%). Both the RCM precipitation estimates can accurately capture the magnitudes of low and moderate daily streamflow, but show limited capabilities in flood prediction in most of the TP basins. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the strength and limitation of RCMs precipitation in hydrological modeling in the TP with complex terrains and sparse gauge observations.</abstract><url hash="76ddc76e">G21-25003</url><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-20-0272.1</doi><bibkey>Sun-2021-Hydrological</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="26"><meta><booktitle>Hydrological Sciences Journal, Volume 66, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>No evidence of isotopic fractionation in olive trees (&lt;i&gt;Olea europaea&lt;/i&gt;): a stable isotope tracing experiment</title><author><first>Anam</first><last>Amin</last></author><author><first>Giulia</first><last>Zuecco</last></author><author><first>Chiara</first><last>Marchina</last></author><author><first>Michael</first><last>Engel</last></author><author><first>Daniele</first><last>Penna</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>Marco</first><last>Borga</last></author><abstract>Plant transpiration is the dominant water flux in the global terrestrial water balance and a key process in the hydrological sciences.

But despite these developments—mostly over the past decade—many technical problems still exist in terms of linking xylem water to its soil water and groundwater sources. This is mainly due to sampling issues and possible fractionation of xylem water. Here we explore whether or not leaf water alone can be used to quantify the blend of rainfall event inputs from which the leaf water originates. Leaf water has historically been avoided in plant water uptake studies due to the extreme fractionation processes at the leaf surface. In our proof of concept work we embrace those processes and use the well-known Craig and Gordon model to map leaf water back to its individual precipitation event water sources. We also employ a Bayesian uncertainty estimation approach to quantify source apportionment uncertainties. We show this using a controlled, vegetated lysimeter experiment where we were able to use leaf water to correctly identify the mean seasonal rainfall that was taken up by the plant, with an uncertainty typically within ±1‰ for δ18O. While not appropriate for all source water studies, this work shows that leaf water isotope composition may provide a new, relatively un-intrusive method for addressing questions about the plant water source.</abstract><url hash="32da6ec9">G21-27001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14073</doi><bibkey>Benettin-2021-On</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="28"><meta><booktitle>Water Resources Research, Volume 57, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Tracing and Closing the Water Balance in a Vegetated Lysimeter</title><author><first>Paolo</first><last>Benettin</last></author><author><first>Magali F.</first><last>Nehemy</last></author><author><first>Mitra</first><last>Asadollahi</last></author><author><first>Dyan</first><last>Pratt</last></author><author><first>Michaël</first><last>Bensimon</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>Andrea</first><last>Rinaldo</last></author><abstract /><url hash="6ab97e9f">G21-28001</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr029049</doi><bibkey>Benettin-2021-Tracing</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Open Science: Open Data, Open Models, …and Open Publications?</title><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Charles H.</first><last>Luce</last></author><author><first>Amir</first><last>AghaKouchak</last></author><author><first>Wouter</first><last>Berghuijs</last></author><author><first>Cédric H.</first><last>David</last></author><author><first>Qingyun</first><last>Duan</last></author><author><first>Shemin</first><last>Ge</last></author><author><first>Ilja</first><last>van Meerveld</last></author><author><first>Chunmiao</first><last>Zheng</last></author><author><first>Marc B.</first><last>Parlange</last></author><author><first>Scott W.</first><last>Tyler</last></author><abstract>This commentary explores the challenges and opportunities associated with a possible transition of Water Resources Research to a publication model where all articles are freely available upon publication (“Gold” open access).

The spatial variability of these changes is attributable to multiple causes. One possible and little-studied cause of changes in high-flow extremes is a change in the synchrony of mainstem and tributary streamflow during high-flow extremes at the mainstem-tributary confluence. We examined reconstructed and simulated naturalized daily streamflow at confluences on the Columbia River in western North America, quantifying changes in synchrony in future streamflow projections and estimating the impact of these changes on high-flow extremes. In the Columbia River basin, projected flow regimes across colder tributaries initially diverge with warming as they respond to climate change at different rates, leading to a general decrease in synchrony, and lower high-flow extremes, relative to a scenario with no changes in synchrony. Where future warming is sufficiently large to cause most subbasins upstream from a confluence to transition toward a rain-dominated, warm regime, the decreasing trend in synchrony reverses itself. At one confluence with a major tributary (the Willamette River), where the mainstem and tributary flow regimes are initially very different, warming increases synchrony and, therefore, high-flow magnitudes. These results may be generalizable to the class of large rivers with large contributions to flood risk from the snow (i.e., cold) regime, but that also receive considerable discharge from tributaries that drain warmer basins.</abstract><url hash="84b71fb3">G21-28003</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr028713</doi><bibkey>Rupp-2021-Changing</bibkey></paper><paper id="4"><title>How Do Climate and Catchment Attributes Influence Flood Generating Processes?

Knowledge about flood generating processes improves hydrological models, flood frequency analysis, estimation of climate change impact on floods, etc. Yet, not much is known about how climate and catchment attributes influence the spatial distribution of flood generating processes. This study aims to offer a comprehensive and structured approach to close this knowledge gap. We employ a large sample approach (671 catchments across the contiguous United States) and evaluate how catchment attributes and climate attributes influence the distribution of flood processes. We use two complementary approaches: A statistics-based approach which compares attribute frequency distributions of different flood processes; and a random forest model in combination with an interpretable machine learning approach (accumulated local effects [ALE]). The ALE method has not been used often in hydrology, and it overcomes a significant obstacle in many statistical methods, the confounding effect of correlated catchment attributes. As expected, we find climate attributes (fraction of snow, aridity, precipitation seasonality, and mean precipitation) to be most influential on flood process distribution. However, the influence of catchment attributes varies both with flood generating process and climate type. We also find flood processes can be predicted for ungauged catchments with relatively high accuracy (R2 between 0.45 and 0.9). The implication of these findings is flood processes should be considered for future climate change impact studies, as the effect of changes in climate on flood characteristics varies between flood processes.</abstract><url hash="1ad38a10">G21-28004</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr028300</doi><bibkey>Stein-2021-How</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="29"><meta><booktitle>Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, Volume 35, Issue 15</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Organic contamination detection for isotopic analysis of water by laser spectroscopy</title><author><first>Cody</first><last>Millar</last></author><author><first>Kim</first><last>Janzen</last></author><author><first>Magali F.</first><last>Nehemy</last></author><author><first>Geoff</first><last>Koehler</last></author><author><first>Pedro</first><last>Hervé‐Fernández</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract>Rationale Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (δ2H, δ17O, and δ18O values) are commonly used tracers of water. These ratios can be measured by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy (IRIS). However, IRIS approaches are prone to errors induced by organic compounds present in plant, soil, and natural water samples. A novel approach using 17O-excess values has shown promise for flagging spectrally contaminated plant samples during IRIS analysis. A systematic assessment of this flagging system is needed to prove it useful. Methods Errors induced by methanol and ethanol water mixtures on measured IRIS and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) results were evaluated. For IRIS analyses both liquid- and vapour-mode (via direct vapour equilibration) methods are used. The δ2H, δ17O, and δ18O values were measured and compared with known reference values to determine the errors induced by methanol and ethanol contamination. In addition, the 17O-excess contamination detection approach was tested. This is a post-processing detection tool for both liquid and vapour IRIS triple-isotope analyses, utilizing calculated 17O-excess values to flag contaminated samples. Results Organic contamination induced significant errors in IRIS results, not seen in IRMS results. Methanol caused larger errors than ethanol. Results from vapour-IRIS analyses had larger errors than those from liquid-IRIS analyses. The 17O-excess approach identified methanol driven error in liquid- and vapour-mode IRIS samples at levels where isotope results became unacceptably erroneous. For ethanol contaminated samples, a mix of erroneous and correct flagging occurred with the 17O-excess method. Our results indicate that methanol is the more problematic contaminant for data corruption. The 17O-excess method was therefore useful for data quality control. Conclusions Organic contamination caused significant errors in IRIS stable isotope results. These errors were larger during vapour analyses than during liquid IRIS analyses, and larger for methanol than ethanol contamination. The 17O-excess method is highly sensitive for detecting narrowband (methanol) contamination error in vapour and liquid analysis modes in IRIS.</abstract><url hash="d20519fa">G21-29001</url><doi>10.1002/rcm.9118</doi><bibkey>Millar-2021-Organic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="30"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, Volume 36</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Tracers reveal limited influence of plantation forests on surface runoff in a UK natural flood management catchment</title><author><first>Leo M.</first><last>Peskett</last></author><author><first>Kate V.</first><last>Heal</last></author><author><first>Alan M.</first><last>MacDonald</last></author><author><first>Andrew R.</first><last>Black</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract>• Natural tracers reveal runoff sources in UK natural flood management catchment. • Water already stored in the catchments dominated runoff in high flow events. • Plantation forest cover reduced the fraction of rapid rainfall runoff. • Soils and geology dominated forest cover as control on rapid rainfall runoff fraction. • Differences in sources were greater between events than between catchments. United Kingdom (UK). Natural flood management (NFM) schemes are increasingly prominent in the UK. Studies of NFM have not yet used natural tracers at catchment scale to investigate how interventions influence partitioning during storms between surface rainfall runoff and water already stored in catchments. Here we investigate how catchment properties, particularly plantation forestry, influence surface storm rainfall runoff. We used hydrograph separation based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes ( 2 H, 18 O) and acid neutralising capacity from high flow events to compare three headwater catchments (2.4-3.1 km 2 ) with differences in plantation forest cover ( Picea sitchensis: 94%, 41%, 1%) within a major UK NFM pilot, typical of the UK uplands. Plantation forest cover reduced the total storm rainfall runoff fraction during all events (by up to 11%) when comparing two paired catchments with similar soils, geology and topography but ∼50% difference in forest cover. However, comparison with the third catchment, with negligible forest cover but different characteristics, suggests that soils and geology were dominant controls on storm rainfall runoff fraction. Furthermore, differences between events were greater than differences between catchments. These findings suggest that while plantation forest cover may influence storm rainfall runoff fractions, it is not a dominant control in temperate upland UK catchments, especially for larger events. Soils and geology may exert greater influence, with implications for planning NFM.</abstract><url hash="926d7fc0">G21-30001</url><pages>100834</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100834</doi><bibkey>Peskett-2021-Tracers</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Interdecadal variability of streamflow in the Hudson Bay Lowlands watersheds driven by atmospheric circulation</title><author><first>Olivier</first><last>Champagne</last></author><author><first>M.

Study Focus The rivers in the Hudson Bay Lowlands are a major source of freshwater entering the Arctic Ocean and they also cause major floods. In recent decades, this region has been affected by major changes in hydroclimatic processes attributed to climate change and natural climate variability. In this study, we used ERA5 reanalysis data, hydrometric observations, and the hydrological model MESH, to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter-decadal variability of streamflow between 1979 and 2018 in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. The natural climate variability was assessed using a weather regimes approach based on the discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis, as well as large scale oceanic and atmospheric variability modes. New hydrological insights The results showed an anomalous convergence of atmospheric moisture flux between 1995–2008 that enhanced precipitation and increased streamflow in the western part of the region. This moisture convergence was likely driven by the combination of (i) low pressure anomalies in the East Coast of North America and (ii) low pressure anomalies in western regions of Canada, associated with the cold phase of the pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). Since 2009, streamflow remains high, likely due to more groundwater discharge associated with the degradation of permafrost.</abstract><url hash="0b642e7a">G21-30002</url><pages>100868</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100868</doi><bibkey>Champagne-2021-Interdecadal</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="31"><meta><booktitle>Forest Ecology and Management, Volume 494</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Tropical forest water source patterns revealed by stable isotopes: A preliminary analysis of 46 neighboring species</title><author><first>Md.

Stable isotope tracing of plant water use can illuminate plant water sources. But to date, the number of species tested at any given site has been minimal. Here, we sample 46 tropical hardwood tree species in a 0.32 ha plot with uniform soils. Soil water was characterized at 6 depths at 0.2 m intervals down to 1 m and showed simple and predictable depth patterns of δ 2 H and δ 18 O, and simple and spatially uniform isotope composition at each depth. Nevertheless, tree xylem water δ 2 H and δ 18 O showed remarkable variation covering the full range of soil composition, suggesting strong sorting and niche segregation across the small plot. Wood density, tree size and mean basal area increment together explained approximately 55% of the variance of xylem water isotope composition through principal component analysis. A Bayesian mixing model was applied to the data and showed that sampled trees were either sourcing their water from very shallow or deep soil layers, with very little contribution from the middle portion of the soil profile. The majority of the observed species relied on 0.0–0.2 m depth soil water. This layer contributed approximately 75% of the xylem water which was significantly higher than the contributions from all other depths. The contribution from shallow soil was highest for trees with high wood density, slow-growing trees and small-sized trees. Our work suggests that stable isotope tracers may aid a better understanding of tropical forest water uptake depths and their relation to tree functional traits and potential hydrological niche segregation among co-occurring tropical species.</abstract><url hash="2ad118a5">G21-31001</url><pages>119355</pages><doi>10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119355</doi><bibkey>Sohel-2021-Tropical</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="32"><meta><booktitle>Science of The Total Environment, Volume 795</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Isotopic fractionation from deep roots to tall shoots: A forensic analysis of xylem water isotope composition in mature tropical savanna trees</title><author><first>Adriana M.</first><last>Vega-Grau</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>Susanne</first><last>Schmidt</last></author><author><first>Mark</first><last>Annandale</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>Herbohn</last></author><abstract>Studies of plant water sources generally assume that xylem water integrates the isotopic composition (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) of water sources and does not fractionate during uptake or transport along the transpiration pathway. However, woody xerophytes, halophytes, and trees in mesic environments can show isotopic fractionation from source waters. Isotopic fractionation and variation in isotope composition can affect the interpretation of tree water sources, but most studies to date have been greenhouse experiments. Here we present a field-based forensic analysis of xylem water isotope composition for 12 Eucalyptus tetrodonta and Corymbia nesophila trees . We used a 25-tonne excavator to access materials from the trees' maximum rooting depth of 3 m to their highest canopies at 38 m. Substantial within-tree variation occurred in δ 2 H (−91.1‰ to −35.7‰ E. tetrodonta ; −88.8‰ to −24.5‰ C. nesophila ) and δ 18 O (−12.3‰ to −5.0‰ E. tetrodonta ; −10.9‰ to −0.3‰ C. nesophila ), with different root-to-branch isotope patterns in each species. Soil water δ 2 H and δ 18 O dual isotope slopes (7.26 E. tetrodonta , 6.66 C. nesophila ) were closest to the Local Meteoric Water Line (8.4). The dual isotope slopes of the trees decreased progressively from roots (6.45 E. tetrodonta , 6.07 C. nesophila ), to stems (4.61 E. tetrodonta , 5.97 C. nesophila ) and branches (4.68 E. tetrodonta , 5.67 C. nesophila ), indicative of fractionation along the xylem stream. Roots of both species were more enriched in 2 H and 18 O than soil water at all sampled depths. Bayesian mixing model analysis showed that estimated proportions of water sourced from different depths reflected the contrasting root systems of these species. Our study adds evidence of isotopic fractionation from water uptake and along the transpiration stream in mature trees in monsoonal environments, affecting the interpretation of water sources. We discuss the findings with view of interpreting aboveground xylem water isotopic composition, incorporating knowledge of root systems. • Isotopic fractionation of xylem water may affect plant water source identification. • We analysed xylem δ 2 H and δ 18 O from roots to branches in mature trees in a savanna. • Fractionation increased from below- to aboveground xylem in the dual isotope space • Root structure assessment helped clarify aboveground interpretation of water use. • Future studies should consider xylem water fractionation and include plant traits.</abstract><url hash="3864b74b">G21-32001</url><pages>148675</pages><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148675</doi><bibkey>Vega-Grau-2021-Isotopic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="33"><meta><booktitle>Ecological Economics, Volume 190</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Measuring the economic value of urban river restoration</title><author><first>Dan</first><last>Dai</last></author><author><first>Roy</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>Kun</first><last>Lei</last></author><abstract>Rivers are under enormous threat worldwide and large amounts of money are invested in river restoration.

In this study, the benefits of restoring different sections of the Yongding River in Beijing, China, are estimated through a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Place attachment is measured by sampling residents upstream and downstream and using the river sections as labelled alternatives in the DCE. As expected, the improvement of water quality is valued highly by all river basin residents, and place attachment and spatial preference heterogeneity play a significant role in public willingness to pay (WTP) for river restoration. Although respondents are willing to give up only a small share of their disposable income, public WTP for improved river water quality is a factor 2 to 4 higher than the current household water bill.

Zooplankton are valuable indicators of aquatic ecosystem health as they play pivotal roles in biochemical cycles while stabilizing food webs. Compared with morphological identification, metabarcoding holds promise for cost-effective, high-throughput, and benchmarkable biomonitoring of zooplankton communities. The objective of this study was to apply DNA and RNA metabarcoding of zooplankton for ecotoxicological assessment and compare it with traditional morphological identification in experimental shoreline enclosures in a boreal lake. These identification methods were also applied in context of assessing response of the zooplankton community exposed to simulated spills of diluted bitumen (dilbit), with experimental remediation practices (enhanced monitored natural recovery and shoreline cleaner application). Metabarcoding detected boreal zooplankton taxa up to the genus level, with a total of 24 shared genera, and while metabarcoding-based relative abundance served as an acceptable proxy for biomass inferred by morphological identification (ρ ≥ 0.52). Morphological identification determined zooplankton community composition changes due to treatments at 11 days post-spill (PERMANOVA, p = 0.0143) while metabarcoding methods indicated changes in zooplankton richness and communities at 38 days post-spill (T-test, p</abstract><url hash="a5b38ff2">G21-35001</url><pages>105847</pages><doi>10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105847</doi><bibkey>Ankley-2021-Using</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="36"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology</booktitle><publisher>American Chemical Society (ACS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Life Cycle Exposure to Environmentally Relevant Concentrations of Diphenyl Phosphate (DPhP) Inhibits Growth and Energy Metabolism of Zebrafish in a Sex-Specific Manner</title><author><first>Qiliang</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Xiaolong</first><last>Lian</last></author><author><first>Jingjing</first><last>An</last></author><author><first>Ningbo</first><last>Geng</last></author><author><first>Haijun</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Jonathan K.</first><last>Challis</last></author><author><first>Yun</first><last>Luo</last></author><author><first>Yaxin</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Guanyong</first><last>Su</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>Yingwen</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Zhihao</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Yanjun</first><last>Shen</last></author><author><first>John P.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><author><first>Yufeng</first><last>Gong</last></author><abstract>Due to commercial uses and environmental degradation of aryl phosphate esters, diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) is frequently detected in environmental matrices and is thus of growing concern worldwide. However, information on potential adverse effects of chronic exposure to DPhP at environmentally realistic concentrations was lacking. Here, we investigated the effects of life cycle exposure to DPhP on zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.8, 3.9, or 35.6 μg/L and employed a dual-omics approach (metabolomics and transcriptomics) to characterize potential modes of action. Exposure to DPhP at 35.6 μg/L for 120 days resulted in significant reductions in body mass and length of male zebrafish, but did not cause those same effects to females. Predominant toxicological mechanisms, including inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation, and up-regulation of phosphatidylcholine degradation, were revealed by integrated dual-omics analysis and successfully linked to adverse outcomes. Activity of succinate dehydrogenase and protein content of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 were significantly decreased in livers of male fish exposed to DPhP, which further confirmed the proposed toxicological mechanisms. This study is the first to demonstrate that chronic, low-level exposure to DPhP can retard growth via inhibiting energy output in male zebrafish.</abstract><url hash="b706201c">G21-36001</url><doi>10.1021/acs.est.1c03948</doi><bibkey>Chen-2021-Life</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="37"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Environmental Sciences, Volume 107</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Comparison of approaches to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using RT-qPCR: Results and implications from a collaborative inter-laboratory study in Canada</title><author><first>Alex H.S.</first><last>Chik</last></author><author><first>Melissa B.</first><last>Glier</last></author><author><first>Mark</first><last>Servos</last></author><author><first>Chand S.</first><last>Mangat</last></author><author><first>Xiao-Li</first><last>Pang</last></author><author><first>Yuanyuan</first><last>Qiu</last></author><author><first>Patrick M.</first><last>D'Aoust</last></author><author><first>Jean-Baptiste</first><last>Burnet</last></author><author><first>Robert</first><last>Delatolla</last></author><author><first>Sarah</first><last>Dorner</last></author><author><first>Qiudi</first><last>Geng</last></author><author><first>John P.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><author><first>Robert Mike</first><last>McKay</last></author><author><first>Michael R.</first><last>Mulvey</last></author><author><first>Natalie</first><last>Prystajecky</last></author><author><first>Nivetha</first><last>Srikanthan</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>Bernadette</first><last>Conant</last></author><author><first>Steve E.</first><last>Hrudey</last></author><abstract>Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater is a promising tool for informing public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, approaches for its analysis by use of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are still far from standardized globally. To characterize inter- and intra-laboratory variability among results when using various methods deployed across Canada, aliquots from a real wastewater sample were spiked with surrogates of SARS-CoV-2 (gamma-radiation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus strain 229E [HCoV-229E]) at low and high levels then provided "blind" to eight laboratories. Concentration estimates reported by individual laboratories were consistently within a 1.0-log10 range for aliquots of the same spiked condition. All laboratories distinguished between low- and high-spikes for both surrogates. As expected, greater variability was observed in the results amongst laboratories than within individual laboratories, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration estimates for each spiked condition remained mostly within 1.0-log10 ranges. The no-spike wastewater aliquots provided yielded non-detects or trace levels (&lt;20 gene copies/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detections appear linked to methods that included or focused on the solids fraction of the wastewater matrix and might represent in-situ SARS-CoV-2 to the wastewater sample. HCoV-229E RNA was not detected in the no-spike aliquots. Overall, all methods yielded comparable results at the conditions tested. Partitioning behavior of SARS-CoV-2 and spiked surrogates in wastewater should be considered to evaluate method effectiveness. A consistent method and laboratory to explore wastewater SARS-CoV-2 temporal trends for a given system, with appropriate quality control protocols and documented in adequate detail should succeed.</abstract><url hash="0fba4779">G21-37001</url><pages>218-229</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jes.2021.01.029</doi><bibkey>Chik-2021-Comparison</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="38"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Pollution, Volume 278</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Responses of juvenile fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) gut microbiome to a chronic dietary exposure of benzo[a]pyrene</title><author><first>Abigail</first><last>DeBofsky</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>Jonathan K.</first><last>Challis</last></author><author><first>Niteesh</first><last>Jain</last></author><author><first>Markus</first><last>Brinkmann</last></author><author><first>Paul D.</first><last>Jones</last></author><author><first>John P.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><abstract>The microbiome has been described as an additional host “organ” with well-established beneficial roles. However, the effects of exposures to chemicals on both structure and function of the gut microbiome of fishes are understudied. To determine effects of benzo[ a ]pyrene (BaP), a model persistent organic pollutant, on structural shifts of gut microbiome in juvenile fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas ), fish were exposed ad libitum in the diet to concentrations of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 μg BaP g −1 food, in addition to a vehicle control, for two weeks. To determine the link between exposure to BaP and changes in the microbial community, concentrations of metabolites of BaP were measured in fish bile and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to evaluate the microbiome. Exposure to BaP only reduced alpha-diversity at the greatest exposure concentrations. However, it did alter community composition assessed as differential abundance of taxa and reduced network complexity of the microbial community in all exposure groups. Results presented here illustrate that environmentally-relevant concentrations of BaP can alter the diversity of the gut microbiome and community network connectivity. Highlights • Dominant phyla of gut microbiome are consistent with those of other freshwater fishes. • BaP metabolites and exposure doses were consistent with those found in contaminated sites. • Dietary BaP exposure has significant, dose-dependent effects on the fish gut microbiome. • Dietary BaP exposure altered association networks of gut microbiome. Environmentally-relevant concentrations of BaP can alter the diversity of the gut microbiome and community network connectivity via dietary exposure route.</abstract><url hash="57d9572f">G21-38001</url><pages>116821</pages><doi>10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116821</doi><bibkey>DeBofsky-2021-Responses</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="39"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, Volume 40, Issue 8</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Effects of Agricultural Stressors on Growth and an Immune Status Indicator in Wood Frog (

Despite this, wood frogs are still present and breeding in altered landscapes, like the agricultural Prairie Pothole Region of central Canada, and are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic impacts. As tadpoles, water contamination can have negative effects on growth, development, and immune systems. To investigate the potential effects of agricultural land use on tadpole growth and immune system stress, we used boosted regression trees to model body mass, body condition, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, a measure of immune stress, against 32 variables including water quality, wetland habitat, and landscape-level measures. Developmental stage strongly influenced all 3 endpoints, and body mass was negatively influenced by higher levels of total dissolved solids (&gt;600-700 mg/L) and at the first sign of pesticide detection (&gt;0.01 proportion pesticides detected of those screened). While correlative, these data suggest that tadpoles developing in agricultural environments may experience survival and reproductive disadvantages if they metamorphose at smaller body sizes. Given the potential impacts this can have on adult frogs and frog populations, these results provide an impetus for further field-based investigation into the effects that pesticides, and especially total dissolved solids, may have on tadpoles.

Since lipids play a vital role in adaptation of organisms to variations in temperature, high-resolution mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics can provide insights into adaptive responses of organisms to a warmer environment in the Arctic and help to illustrate potential novel roles of lipids in the process of thermal adaption. In this study, we studied an ecologically and economically important species-Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus)-with a detailed multi-tissue analysis of the lipidome in response to chronic shifts in temperature using a validated lipidomics workflow. In addition, dynamic alterations in the hepatic lipidome during the time course of shifts in temperature were also characterized. Our results showed that early life stages of Arctic char were more susceptible to variations in temperature. One-year-old Arctic char responded to chronic increases in temperature with coordinated regulation of lipids, including headgroup-specific remodeling of acyl chains in glycerophospholipids (GP) and extensive alterations in composition of lipids in membranes, such as less lyso-GPs, and more ether-GPs and sphingomyelin. Glycerolipids (e.g., triacylglycerol, TG) also participated in adaptive responses of the lipidome of Arctic char. Eight-week-old Arctic char exhibited rapid adaptive alterations of the hepatic lipidome to stepwise decreases in temperature while showing blunted responses to gradual increases in temperature, implying an inability to adapt rapidly to warmer environments. Three common phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) (PE 36:6|PE 16:1_20:5, PE 38:7|PE 16:1_22:6, and PE 40:7|PE 18:1_22:6) were finally identified as candidate lipid biomarkers for temperature shifts via machine learning approach. Overall, this work provides additional information to a better understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms of the lipidome of Arctic organisms in the face of near-future warming.</abstract><url hash="204da3d0">G21-40001</url><pages>3282-3298</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15638</doi><bibkey>Wang-2021-Remodeling</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="41"><meta><booktitle>Diversity and Distributions, Volume 27, Issue 10</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Environmental DNA of preservative ethanol performed better than water samples in detecting macroinvertebrate diversity using metabarcoding</title><author><first>Yu</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Kai</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Jin</first><last>Gao</last></author><author><first>Meng</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Jie</first><last>Dong</last></author><author><first>Yuwei</first><last>Xie</last></author><author><first>John P.</first><last>Giesy</last></author><author><first>Xiaowei</first><last>Jin</last></author><author><first>Beixin</first><last>Wang</last></author><abstract /><url hash="98f1c4b5">G21-41001</url><pages>1989-2002</pages><doi>10.1111/ddi.13284</doi><bibkey>Wang-2021-Environmental</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="42"><meta><booktitle>2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS</booktitle><publisher>IEEE</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Support Vector Regression for Chlorophyll-A Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Images in Small Waterbodies</title><author><first>Amir M.</first><last>Chegoonian</last></author><author><first>Kiana</first><last>Zolfaghari</last></author><author><first>Helen M.</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>Claude R.</first><last>Duguay</last></author><abstract>Chlorophyll-a concentration (chla) is a useful indicator of harmful algal blooms in early warning systems that use remote sensing data as input. However, its retrieval is challenging in small waterbodies due to the lack of high spatial-resolution water-color sensors and the substantial optical interference of other water constituents. Here, we demonstrate the potential of support vector machines and Sentinel-2 images to retrieve chla in a shallow eutrophic lake (Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada). Following validation against in-situ chla measurements over three open water seasons (2017–2019), our proposed method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms the most common semi-empirical models, i.e., locally-tuned indices (normalized difference chlorophyll index, 2band, and 3band), as well as the state-of-the-art global empirical model (Mixture Density Network). The superiority of SVR is shown in terms of overall and stratified accuracy, as well as spatial validity. We argue that for small waterbodies where numerous matched pairs of in-situ chla and reflectance are not available, SVR might retrieve chla more accurately than locally-tuned indices and global empirical models.</abstract><url hash="8a446b5b">G21-42001</url><doi>10.1109/igarss47720.2021.9554110</doi><bibkey>Chegoonian-2021-Support</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="43"><meta><booktitle>Lake and Reservoir Management, Volume 38, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria</title><author><first>Heather A.</first><last>Haig</last></author><author><first>Amir M.</first><last>Chegoonian</last></author><author><first>John-Mark</first><last>Davies</last></author><author><first>Deirdre</first><last>Bateson</last></author><author><first>Peter R.</first><last>Leavitt</last></author><abstract>Haig HA, Chegoonian AM, Davies J-M, Bateson D, Leavitt PR. 2021.

The P fertilization rates were high enough (13.3 µ g l −1 added weekly) to produce dense, month-long blooms of N 2 -fixing Dolichospermum species in both lakes within 9–12 weeks after fertilization began, turning them visibly green without the addition of nitrogen. P-only fertilization increased average seasonal chlorophyll a concentrations and cyanobacteria biomass well above the pre-fertilization levels of 2017 and 2018. Nitrogen (N) content in the epilimnion of thermally stratified Lake 304 and the water column of shallow Lake 303 doubled and P storage in the water column temporarily increased during the blooms. These whole-lake fertilization experiments demonstrate that large cyanobacteria blooms can develop rapidly under high P loading without anthropogenic N inputs, suggesting that aggressive N control programs are unlikely to prevent bloom formation and that P controls should remain the cornerstone for cyanobacteria management.</abstract><url hash="179353e2">G21-45001</url><pages>064078</pages><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac0564</doi><bibkey>Molot-2021-Phosphorus-only</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="46"><meta><booktitle>Limnology and Oceanography, Volume 67, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Warming combined with experimental eutrophication intensifies lake phytoplankton blooms</title><author><first>Kateri R.</first><last>Salk</last></author><author><first>Jason J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>Raoul‐Marie</first><last>Couture</last></author><author><first>Scott N.</first><last>Higgins</last></author><author><first>Michael J.</first><last>Paterson</last></author><author><first>Sherry L.</first><last>Schiff</last></author><abstract>Phytoplankton blooms are a global water quality issue, and successful management depends on understanding their responses to multiple and interacting drivers, including nutrient loading and climate change. Here, we examine a long-term dataset from Lake 227, a site subject to a fertilization experiment (1969–present) with changing nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios. We applied a process-oriented model, MyLake, and updated the model structure with nutrient uptake kinetics that incorporated shifting N:P and competition among phytoplankton functional groups. We also tested different temperature and P-loading scenarios to examine the interacting effects of climate change and nutrient loading on phytoplankton blooms. The model successfully reproduced lake physics over 48 yr and the timing, overall magnitude, and shifting community structure (diazotrophs vs. non-diazotrophs) of phytoplankton blooms. Intra- and interannual variability was captured more accurately for the P-only fertilization period than for the high N:P and low N:P fertilization periods, highlighting the difficulty of modeling complex blooms even in well-studied systems. A model scenario was also run which removed climate-driven temperature trends, allowing us to disentangle concurrent drivers of blooms. Results showed that increases in water temperature in the spring led to earlier and larger phytoplankton blooms under climate change than under the effects of nutrient fertilization alone. These findings suggest that successful lake management efforts should incorporate the effects of climate change in addition to nutrient reductions, including intensifying and/or expanding monitoring periods and incorporating climate change into uncertainty estimates around future conditions.</abstract><url hash="0526fc0c">G21-46001</url><pages>147-158</pages><doi>10.1002/lno.11982</doi><bibkey>Salk-2021-Warming</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="47"><meta><booktitle>ACS Earth and Space Chemistry, Volume 5, Issue 12</booktitle><publisher>American Chemical Society (ACS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Persistence of Uranium in Old and Cold Subpermafrost Groundwater Indicated by Linking &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U-&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U-&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, Groundwater Ages, and Hydrogeochemistry</title><author><first>Elliott K.</first><last>Skierszkan</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Dockrey</last></author><author><first>Jordi</first><last>Helsen</last></author><author><first>Laura-Lee</first><last>Findlater</last></author><author><first>Clément P.</first><last>Bataille</last></author><author><first>Ghislain</first><last>de Laplante</last></author><author><first>Joyce M.</first><last>McBeth</last></author><author><first>K.

Yet, they are not passive victims; local-level programs are being implemented across the region to maintain livelihoods and promote adaptation. At the same time, there is a recent call within global governance literature to pay attention to how global policy is implemented and affecting people on the ground. Thinking about these two processes, we ask the question: (how) can global governance assist northern Indigenous communities in Canada in reaching their goals of adapting their food systems to climate change? To answer this question, we argue for a “community needs” approach when engaging in global governance literature and practice, which puts community priorities and decision-making first. As part of a collaborative research partnership, we highlight the experiences of Ka’a’gee Tu First Nation, located in Kakisa, NWT, Canada. We include their successes of engaging in global network building and the systemic roadblock of lack of formal land tenure. Moreover, we analyze potential opportunities for this community to engage with global governance instruments and continue connecting to global networks that further their goals related to climate change adaptation and food sovereignty.</abstract><url hash="e5f98b3f">G21-48001</url><pages>2415</pages><doi>10.3390/su13042415</doi><bibkey>Johnston-2021-Grassroots</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="49"><meta><booktitle>Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, Volume 5</booktitle><publisher>Frontiers Media SA</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Northern Food Systems in Transition: The Role of the Emerging Agri-Food Industry in the Northwest Territories (Canada) Food System</title><author><first>Margaret A.</first><last>Lemay</last></author><author><first>Josalyn</first><last>Radcliffe</last></author><author><first>David</first><last>Bysouth</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Spring</last></author><abstract>This paper reports the findings of an ethnographic study that involved working with local organizations, food advocates, and communities to develop strategies for expanding the nascent Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada agri-food industry. The NWT represents a unique case study in that the fledging agri-food industry has been recognized for its promise in contributing to the core goals of the transitioning NWT food system. The study is guided by two research questions: (1) How is the promise of the emerging NWT agri-food industry framed within the context of the broader food system? (2) Given this framing of the NWT agri-food industry, how can it contribute to the sustainability of the NWT food system and to the goals of food security, poverty reduction, nutrition, and economic development? Grounded in a food systems approach, we used a correlative, evolutionary SWOT analysis to profile the nascent NWT agri-food industry within the context of the existing NWT food system. Through further thematic analysis, we identify and describe two dominant narratives (agri-food industry business case narrative and agri-food industry implications narrative) and key themes within the narratives based on an adapted food systems framework. The agri-food business case narrative highlights discourse articulating the business or commercial viability for a local agri-food value chain to function, evolve, and expand. The agri-food industry implications narrative envisions the ways in which the emerging NWT agri-food industry may interact within the existing NWT food system, highlighting potential environmental, social, cultural, and political implications of an expanding commercial-based agri-food value chain. Within the two narratives, certain subcomponents of the NWT agri-food system appear to be more prevalent, including climate, soil, and ecosystems, policy/regulations/governance, socio-cultural norms, knowledge, inputs, finance, production, and consumption. We make policy and practice recommendations for co-designing an agri-food industry that serves the multiple goals of the NWT food system. As an exploratory, descriptive-structural analysis the study provides a critical empirical basis for future in-depth, fully integrated synthesis of the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and ecological dynamics shaping Northern food systems in transition.</abstract><url hash="5d45ec5a">G21-49001</url><doi>10.3389/fsufs.2021.661538</doi><bibkey>Lemay-2021-Northern</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="50"><meta><booktitle>Earth's Future, Volume 9, Issue 10</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Biases Beyond the Mean in CMIP6 Extreme Precipitation: A Global Investigation</title><author><first>Hebatallah Mohamed</first><last>Abdelmoaty</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>Chandra Rupa</first><last>Rajulapati</last></author><author><first>Amir</first><last>AghaKouchak</last></author><abstract>Climate models are crucial for assessing climate variability and change. A reliable model for future climate should reasonably simulate the historical climate. Here, we assess the performance of CMIP6 models in reproducing statistical properties of observed annual maxima of daily precipitation. We go beyond the commonly used methods and assess CMIP6 simulations on three scales by performing: (a) univariate comparison based on L-moments and relative difference measures; (b) bivariate comparison using Kernel densities of mean and L-variation, and of L-skewness and L-kurtosis, and (c) comparison of the entire distribution function using the Generalized Extreme Value () distribution coupled with a novel application of the Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-fit test. The results reveal that the statistical shape properties (related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes) of CMIP6 simulations match well with the observational datasets. The simulated mean and variation differ among the models with 70% of simulations having a difference within 10% from the observations. Biases are observed in the bivariate investigation of mean and variation. Several models perform well with the HadGEM3-GC31-MM model performing well in all three scales when compared to the ground-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre data. Finally, the study highlights biases of CMIP6 models in simulating extreme precipitation in the Arctic, Tropics, arid and semi-arid regions.</abstract><url hash="1d2d8a60">G21-50001</url><doi>10.1029/2021ef002196</doi><bibkey>Abdelmoaty-2021-Biases</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Probabilistic Evaluation of Drought in CMIP6 Simulations</title><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>Chandra Rupa</first><last>Rajulapati</last></author><author><first>Konstantinos M.</first><last>Andreadis</last></author><author><first>Efi</first><last>Foufoula‐Georgiou</last></author><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Kevin E.</first><last>Trenberth</last></author><abstract>As droughts have widespread social and ecological impacts, it is critical to develop long-term adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce drought vulnerability. Climate models are important in quantifying drought changes. Here, we assess the ability of 285 CMIP6 historical simulations, from 17 models, to reproduce drought duration and severity in three observational data sets using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). We used summary statistics beyond the mean and standard deviation, and devised a novel probabilistic framework, based on the Hellinger distance, to quantify the difference between observed and simulated drought characteristics. Results show that many simulations have less than ±10% error in reproducing the observed drought summary statistics. The hypothesis that simulations and observations are described by the same distribution cannot be rejected for more than 80% of the grids based on our H distance framework. No single model stood out as demonstrating consistently better performance over large regions of the globe. The variance in drought statistics among the simulations is higher in the tropics compared to other latitudinal zones. Though the models capture the characteristics of dry spells well, there is considerable bias in low precipitation values. Good model performance in terms of SPI does not imply good performance in simulating low precipitation. Our study emphasizes the need to probabilistically evaluate climate model simulations in order to both pinpoint model weaknesses and identify a subset of best-performing models that are useful for impact assessments.</abstract><url hash="8424dbda">G21-50002</url><doi>10.1029/2021ef002150</doi><bibkey>Papalexiou-2021-Probabilistic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="51"><meta><booktitle>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Volume 25, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Flood spatial coherence, triggers, and performance in hydrological simulations: large-sample evaluation of four streamflow-calibrated models</title><author><first>Manuela I.</first><last>Brunner</last></author><author><first>Lieke A.</first><last>Melsen</last></author><author><first>Andrew W.</first><last>Wood</last></author><author><first>Oldrich</first><last>Rakovec</last></author><author><first>Naoki</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>Wouter J.

Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments. This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling–Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms. To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes. Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions. From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling–Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.</abstract><url hash="a591ed05">G21-51001</url><pages>105-119</pages><doi>10.5194/hess-25-105-2021</doi><bibkey>Brunner-2021-Flood</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="52"><meta><booktitle>WIREs Water, Volume 8, Issue 3</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Challenges in modeling and predicting floods and droughts: A review</title><author><first>Manuela I.</first><last>Brunner</last></author><author><first>Louise</first><last>Slater</last></author><author><first>Lena M.</first><last>Tallaksen</last></author><author><first>Martyn</first><last>Clark</last></author><abstract /><url hash="b72442eb">G21-52001</url><doi>10.1002/wat2.1520</doi><bibkey>Brunner-2021-Challenges</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="53"><meta><booktitle>Water Resources Research, Volume 57, Issue 9</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Abuse of Popular Performance Metrics in Hydrologic Modeling</title><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Richard M.</first><last>Vogel</last></author><author><first>Jonathan R.</first><last>Lamontagne</last></author><author><first>Naoki</first><last>Mizukami</last></author><author><first>Wouter J.

We focus on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large-sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.</abstract><url hash="0f98258e">G21-53001</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr029001</doi><bibkey>Clark-Vogel-2021-The-Abuse</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="54"><meta><booktitle>Water, Volume 13, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Exploring the Potential of Zoning Regulation for Reducing Ice-Jam Flood Risk Using a Stochastic Modelling Framework</title><author><first>Apurba</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>Karl-Erich</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>Ice-jam floods pose a serious threat to many riverside communities in cold regions. Ice-jam-related flooding can cause loss of human life, millions of dollars in property damage, and adverse impacts on ecology. An effective flood management strategy is necessary to reduce the overall risk in flood-prone areas. Most of these strategies require a detailed risk-based management study to assess their effectiveness in reducing flood risk. Zoning regulation is a sustainable measure to reduce overall flood risk for a flood-prone area. Zoning regulation is a specified area in a floodplain where certain restrictions apply to different land uses (e.g., development or business). A stochastic framework was introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of a potential zoning regulation. A stochastic framework encompasses the impacts of all the possible expected floods instead of a more traditional approach where a single design flood is incorporated. The downtown area of Fort McMurray along the Athabasca River was selected to explore the impact of zoning regulation on reducing expected annual damages (EAD) from ice-jam flooding. The results show that a hypothetical zoning regulation for a certain area in the town of Fort McMurray (TFM) can be effective in substantially reducing the level of EAD. A global sensitivity analysis was also applied to understand the impacts of model inputs on ice-jam flood risk using a regional sensitivity method. The results show that model boundary conditions such as river discharge, the inflowing volume of ice and ice-jam toe locations are highly sensitive to ice-jam flood risk.</abstract><url hash="924f1d37">G21-54001</url><pages>2202</pages><doi>10.3390/w13162202</doi><bibkey>Das-2021-Exploring</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="55"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Reviews, Volume 29, Issue 3</booktitle><publisher>Canadian Science Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Modelling climatic impacts on ice-jam floods: a review of current models, modelling capabilities, challenges, and future prospects</title><author><first>Apurba</first><last>Das</last></author><author><first>Karl-Erich</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>River ice is an important hydraulic and hydrological component of many rivers in the high northern latitudes of the world. It controls the hydraulic characteristics of streamflow, affects the geomorphology of channels, and can cause flooding due to ice-jam formation during ice-cover freeze-up and breakup periods. In recent decades, climate change has considerably altered ice regimes, affecting the severity of ice-jam flooding. Although many approaches have been developed to model river ice regimes and the severity of ice-jam flooding, appropriate methods that account for the impacts of future climate on ice-jam flooding have not been well established. Therefore, the main goals of this study are to review current knowledge regarding climate change impacts on river ice processes and to assess current modelling capabilities to determine the severity of ice jams under future climatic conditions. Finally, a conceptual river ice-jam modelling approach is presented for incorporating climate change impacts on ice jams.</abstract><url hash="2af37a52">G21-55001</url><pages>378-390</pages><doi>10.1139/er-2020-0108</doi><bibkey>Das-2021-Modelling</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="56"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrology, Volume 600</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Towards more realistic runoff projections by removing limits on simulated soil moisture deficit</title><author><first>Keirnan J.A.</first><last>Fowler</last></author><author><first>Gemma</first><last>Coxon</last></author><author><first>Jim E.</first><last>Freer</last></author><author><first>Wouter J.M.</first><last>Knoben</last></author><author><first>Murray C.</first><last>Peel</last></author><author><first>Thorsten</first><last>Wagener</last></author><author><first>Andrew W.</first><last>Western</last></author><author><first>Ross A.</first><last>Woods</last></author><author><first>Lu</first><last>Zhang</last></author><abstract>• Most conceptual bucket models have an upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit. • Problems arise when the bucket “empties” because ET drops to unrealistic (low) levels. • Alternatives include bottomless buckets or deficit-based soil moisture accounting. • Here, we switch to a deficit-based scheme while keeping everything else constant. • Tested over historic drought, model performance and realism are enhanced. Rainfall-runoff models based on conceptual “buckets” are frequently used in climate change impact studies to provide runoff projections. When these buckets approach empty, the simulated evapotranspiration approaches zero, which places an implicit limit on the soil moisture deficit that can accrue within the model. Such models may cease to properly track the moisture deficit accumulating in reality as dry conditions continue, leading to overestimation of subsequent runoff and possible long-term bias under drying climate. Here, we suggest that model realism may be improved through alternatives which remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit, such as “bottomless” buckets or deficit-based soil moisture accounting. While some existing models incorporate such measures, no study until now has systematically assessed their impact on model realism under drying climate. Here, we alter a common bucket model by changing the soil moisture storage to a deficit accounting system in such a way as to remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit. Tested on 38 Australian catchments, the altered model is better able to track the decline in soil moisture at the end of seasonal dry periods, which leads to superior performance over varied historic climate, including the 13-year “Millennium” drought. However, groundwater and GRACE data reveal long-term trends that are not matched in simulations, indicating that further changes may be required. Nonetheless, the results suggest that a broader adoption of bottomless buckets and/or deficit accounting within conceptual rainfall runoff models may improve the realism of runoff projections under drying climate.</abstract><url hash="3846d5bc">G21-56001</url><pages>126505</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126505</doi><bibkey>Fowler-2021-Towards</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="57"><meta><booktitle>Water Resources Research, Volume 57, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Mimicry of a Conceptual Hydrological Model (HBV): What's in a Name?</title><author><first>Koen F.</first><last>Jansen</last></author><author><first>Adriaan J.</first><last>Teuling</last></author><author><first>James R.</first><last>Craig</last></author><author><first>Marco</first><last>Dal Molin</last></author><author><first>Wouter J.

This study assesses model structure differences and their impact on output by comparing 7 model implementations that carry the name HBV. We explain and quantify output differences with individual model structure components at both the numerical (e.g., explicit/implicit scheme) and mathematical level (e.g., lineair/power outflow). It was found that none of the numerical and mathematical formulations of the mimicking models were (originally) the same as the benchmark, HBV-light. This led to small but distinct output differences in simulated streamflow for different numerical implementations (KGE difference up to 0.15), and major output differences due to mathematical differences (KGE median loss of 0.27). These differences decreased after calibrating the individual models to the simulated streamflow of the benchmark model. We argue that the lack of systematic model naming has led to a diverging concept of the HBV-model, diminishing the concept of model mimicry. Development of a systematic model naming framework, open accessible model code and more elaborate model descriptions are suggested to enhance model mimicry and model development.</abstract><url hash="80fab2d9">G21-57001</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr029143</doi><bibkey>Jansen-2021-Mimicry</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Fill‐and‐Spill: A Process Description of Runoff Generation at the Scale of the Beholder</title><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>Christopher</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>Daniel J.</first><last>Karran</last></author><author><first>H.

Here idealized perturbations to land surface properties are imposed in a global model to understand how such forcings drive shifts in zonal mean atmospheric energy transport and zonal mean tropical precipitation. For a uniform decrease in global land albedo, the albedo forcing and a positive water vapor feedback contribute roughly equally to increased energy absorption at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), while radiative changes due to the temperature and cloud cover response provide a negative feedback and energy loss at TOA. Decreasing land albedo causes a northwards shift in the zonal mean intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The combined effects on ITCZ location of all atmospheric feedbacks roughly cancel for the albedo forcing; the total ITCZ shift is comparable to that predicted for the albedo forcing alone. For an imposed increase in evaporative resistance that reduces land evaporation, low cloud cover decreases in the northern mid-latitudes and more energy is absorbed at TOA there; longwave loss due to warming provides a negative feedback on the TOA energy balance and ITCZ shift. Imposed changes in land albedo and evaporative resistance modulate fundamentally different aspects of the surface energy budget. However, the pattern of TOA radiation changes due to the water vapor and air temperature responses are highly correlated for these two forcings because both forcings lead to near-surface warming.</abstract><url hash="d899a28f">G21-58001</url><pages>1-63</pages><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-20-0883.1</doi><bibkey>Laguë-2021-Radiative</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="59"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Climate, Volume 34, Issue 6</booktitle><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Terrestrial Evaporation and Global Climate: Lessons from Northland, a Planet with a Hemispheric Continent</title><author><first>Marysa M.</first><last>Laguë</last></author><author><first>Marianne</first><last>Pietschnig</last></author><author><first>Sarah</first><last>Ragen</last></author><author><first>Timothy A.</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>David S.</first><last>Battisti</last></author><abstract>Abstract Motivated by the hemispheric asymmetry of land distribution on Earth, we explore the climate of Northland, a highly idealized planet with a Northern Hemisphere continent and a Southern Hemisphere ocean. The climate of Northland can be separated into four distinct regions: the Southern Hemisphere ocean, the seasonally wet tropics, the midlatitude desert, and the Great Northern Swamp. We evaluate how modifying land surface properties on Northland drives changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns, the global energy budget, and atmospheric dynamics. We observe a surprising response to changes in land surface evaporation, where suppressing terrestrial evaporation in Northland cools both land and ocean. In previous studies, suppressing terrestrial evaporation has been found to lead to local warming by reducing latent cooling of the land surface. However, reduced evaporation can also decrease atmospheric water vapor, reducing the strength of the greenhouse effect and leading to large-scale cooling. We use a set of idealized climate model simulations to show that suppressing terrestrial evaporation over Northern Hemisphere continents of varying size can lead to either warming or cooling of the land surface, depending on which of these competing effects dominates. We find that a combination of total land area and contiguous continent size controls the balance between local warming from reduced latent heat flux and large-scale cooling from reduced atmospheric water vapor. Finally, we demonstrate how terrestrial heat capacity, albedo, and evaporation all modulate the location of the ITCZ both over the continent and over the ocean.</abstract><url hash="6025c5ea">G21-59001</url><pages>2253-2276</pages><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-20-0452.1</doi><bibkey>Laguë-2021-Terrestrial</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="60"><meta><booktitle>Hydrological Processes, Volume 35, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Leveraging ensemble meteorological forcing data to improve parameter estimation of hydrologic models</title><author><first>Hongli</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Bryan A.</first><last>Tolson</last></author><author><first>Andrew J.</first><last>Newman</last></author><author><first>Andrew W.</first><last>Wood</last></author><abstract>As continental to global scale high-resolution meteorological datasets continue to be developed, there are sufficient meteorological datasets available now for modellers to construct a historical forcing ensemble. The forcing ensemble can be a collection of multiple deterministic meteorological datasets or come from an ensemble meteorological dataset. In hydrological model calibration, the forcing ensemble can be used to represent forcing data uncertainty. This study examines the potential of using the forcing ensemble to identify more robust parameters through model calibration. Specifically, we compare an ensemble forcing-based calibration with two deterministic forcing-based calibrations and investigate their flow simulation and parameter estimation properties and the ability to resist poor-quality forcings. The comparison experiment is conducted with a six-parameter hydrological model for 30 synthetic studies and 20 real data studies to provide a better assessment of the average performance of the deterministic and ensemble forcing-based calibrations. Results show that the ensemble forcing-based calibration generates parameter estimates that are less biased and have higher frequency of covering the true parameter values than the deterministic forcing-based calibration does. Using a forcing ensemble in model calibration reduces the risk of inaccurate flow simulation caused by poor-quality meteorological inputs, and improves the reliability and overall simulation skill of ensemble simulation results. The poor-quality meteorological inputs can be effectively filtered out via our ensemble forcing-based calibration methodology and thus discarded in any post-calibration model applications. The proposed ensemble forcing-based calibration method can be considered as a more generalized framework to include parameter and forcing uncertainties in model calibration.</abstract><url hash="5a8df0b0">G21-60001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14410</doi><bibkey>Liu-2021-Leveraging</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Ten best practices to strengthen stewardship and sharing of water science data in Canada</title><author><first>Bhaleka D.</first><last>Persaud</last></author><author><first>Krysha A.</first><last>Dukacz</last></author><author><first>Gopal C.</first><last>Saha</last></author><author><first>Amber</first><last>Peterson</last></author><author><first>Laleh</first><last>Moradi</last></author><author><first>Stephen</first><last>O'Hearn</last></author><author><first>Erin</first><last>Clary</last></author><author><first>Juliane</first><last>Mai</last></author><author><first>Michael</first><last>Steeleworthy</last></author><author><first>Jason J.</first><last>Venkiteswaran</last></author><author><first>Homa</first><last>Kheyrollah Pour</last></author><author><first>Brent B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>Sean K.</first><last>Carey</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Chris M.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>James M.</first><last>Waddington</last></author><author><first>Philippe</first><last>Van Cappellen</last></author><author><first>Jimmy</first><last>Lin</last></author><abstract>Water science data are a valuable asset that both underpins the original research project and bolsters new research questions, particularly in view of the increasingly complex water issues facing Canada and the world. Whilst there is general support for making data more broadly accessible, and a number of water science journals and funding agencies have adopted policies that require researchers to share data in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, there are still questions about effective management of data to protect their usefulness over time. Incorporating data management practices and standards at the outset of a water science research project will enable researchers to efficiently locate, analyze and use data throughout the project lifecycle, and will ensure the data maintain their value after the project has ended. Here, some common misconceptions about data management are highlighted, along with insights and practical advice to assist established and early career water science researchers as they integrate data management best practices and tools into their research. Freely available tools and training opportunities made available in Canada through Global Water Futures, the Portage Network, Gordon Foundation's DataStream, Compute Canada, and university libraries, among others are compiled. These include webinars, training videos, and individual support for the water science community that together enable researchers to protect their data assets and meet the expectations of journals and funders. The perspectives shared here have been developed as part of the Global Water Futures programme's efforts to improve data management and promote the use of common data practices and standards in the context of water science in Canada. Ten best practices are proposed that may be broadly applicable to other disciplines in the natural sciences and can be adopted and adapted globally. This article is protected by copyright.

This study employs a stochastic hydrologic modeling framework to evaluate the sensitivity of flood frequency analyses to different components of the hydrologic modeling chain. The major components of the stochastic hydrologic modeling chain, including model structure, model parameter estimation, initial conditions, and precipitation inputs were examined across return periods from 2 to 100 000 years at two watersheds representing different hydroclimates across the western USA. A total of 10 hydrologic model structures were configured, calibrated, and run within the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) modular modeling framework for each of the two watersheds. Model parameters and initial conditions were derived from long-term calibrated simulations using a 100 member historical meteorology ensemble. A stochastic event-based hydrologic modeling workflow was developed using the calibrated models in which millions of flood event simulations were performed for each basin. The analysis of variance method was then used to quantify the relative contributions of model structure, model parameters, initial conditions, and precipitation inputs to flood magnitudes for different return periods. Results demonstrate that different components of the modeling chain have different sensitivities for different return periods. Precipitation inputs contribute most to the variance of rare floods, while initial conditions are most influential for more frequent events. However, the hydrological model structure and structure–parameter interactions together play an equally important role in specific cases, depending on the basin characteristics and type of flood metric of interest. This study highlights the importance of critically assessing model underpinnings, understanding flood generation processes, and selecting appropriate hydrological models that are consistent with our understanding of flood generation processes.</abstract><url hash="48385f5e">G21-63001</url><pages>5603-5621</pages><doi>10.5194/hess-25-5603-2021</doi><bibkey>Newman-2021-Identifying</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="64"><meta><booktitle>Hydrological Sciences Journal, Volume 67, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Effects of quality controlled measured and re-analysed meteorological data on the performance of water temperature simulations</title><author><first>Amir</first><last>Sadeghian</last></author><author><first>Jeff</first><last>Hudson</last></author><author><first>Karl-Erich</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="d5ef67e7">G21-64001</url><pages>21-39</pages><doi>10.1080/02626667.2021.1994975</doi><bibkey>Sadeghian-2021-Effects</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="65"><meta><booktitle>Water Resources Research, Volume 57, Issue 7</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>VISCOUS: A Variance‐Based Sensitivity Analysis Using Copulas for Efficient Identification of Dominant Hydrological Processes</title><author><first>Razi</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>Shervan</first><last>Gharari</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>Martyn P</first><last>Clark</last></author><abstract>Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has long been recognized as an indispensable tool for model analysis. GSA has been extensively used for model simplification, identifiability analysis, and diagnostic tests. Nevertheless, computationally efficient methodologies are needed for GSA, not only to reduce the computational overhead, but also to improve the quality and robustness of the results. This is especially the case for process-based hydrologic models, as their simulation time typically exceeds the computational resources available for a comprehensive GSA. To overcome this computational barrier, we propose a data-driven method called VISCOUS, variance-based sensitivity analysis using copulas. VISCOUS uses Gaussian mixture copulas to approximate the joint probability density function of a given set of input-output pairs for estimating the variance-based sensitivity indices. Our method identifies dominant hydrologic factors by recycling existing input-output data, and thus can deal with arbitrary sample sets drawn from the input-output space. We used two hydrologic models of increasing complexity (HBV and VIC) to assess the performance of VISCOUS. Our results confirm that VISCOUS and the conventional variance-based method can detect similar important and unimportant factors. Furthermore, the VISCOUS method can substantially reduce the computational cost required for sensitivity analysis. Our proposed method is particularly useful for process-based models with many uncertain parameters, large domain size, and high spatial and temporal resolution.</abstract><url hash="6d530082">G21-65001</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr028435</doi><bibkey>Sheikholeslami-2021-VISCOUS:</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Heterogeneous Changes to Wetlands in the Canadian Prairies Under Future Climate</title><author><first>Zhe</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Lauren E.</first><last>Bortolotti</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Llwellyn M.</first><last>Armstrong</last></author><author><first>Tom W.</first><last>Bell</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Numerous wetlands in the prairies of Canada provide important ecosystem services, yet are threatened by climate and land-use changes. Understanding the impacts of climate change on prairie wetlands is critical to effective conservation planning. In this study, we construct a wetland model with surface water balance and ecoregions to project future distribution of wetlands. The climatic conditions downscaled from the Weather Research and Forecasting model were used to drive the Noah-MP land surface model to obtain surface water balance. The climate change perturbation is derived from an ensemble of general circulation models using the pseudo global warming method, under the RCP8.5 emission scenario by the end of 21st century. The results show that climate change impacts on wetland extent are spatiotemporally heterogenous. Future wetter climate in the western Prairies will favor increased wetland abundance in both spring and summer. In the eastern Prairies, particularly in the mixed grassland and mid-boreal upland, wetland areas will increase in spring but experience enhanced declines in summer due to strong evapotranspiration. When these effects of climate change are considered in light of historical drainage, they suggest a need for diverse conservation and restoration strategies. For the mixed grassland in the western Canadian Prairies, wetland restoration will be favorable, while the highly drained eastern Prairies will be challenged by the intensified hydrological cycle. The outcomes of this study will be useful to conservation agencies to ensure that current investments will continue to provide good conservation returns in the future.</abstract><url hash="f45a5138">G21-65002</url><doi>10.1029/2020wr028727</doi><bibkey>Zhang-2021-Heterogeneous</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="66"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Climate, Volume 34, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>SC-Earth: A Station-Based Serially Complete Earth Dataset from 1950 to 2019</title><author><first>Guoqiang</first><last>Tang</last></author><author><first>Martyn P.</first><last>Clark</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract>Abstract Meteorological data from ground stations suffer from temporal discontinuities caused by missing values and short measurement periods. Gap-filling and reconstruction techniques have proven to be effective in producing serially complete station datasets (SCDs) that are used for a myriad of meteorological applications (e.g., developing gridded meteorological datasets and validating models). To our knowledge, all SCDs are developed at regional scales. In this study, we developed the serially complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which provides daily precipitation, mean temperature, temperature range, dewpoint temperature, and wind speed data from 1950 to 2019. SC-Earth utilizes raw station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily (GHCN-D) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). A unified station repository is generated based on GHCN-D and GSOD after station merging and strict quality control. ERA5 is optimally matched with station data considering the time shift issue and then used to assist the global gap filling. SC-Earth is generated by merging estimates from 15 strategies based on quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, machine learning, and multistrategy merging. The final estimates are bias corrected using a combination of quantile mapping and quantile delta mapping. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that SC-Earth has high accuracy around the globe, with degraded quality in the tropics and oceanic islands due to sparse station networks, strong spatial precipitation gradients, and degraded ERA5 estimates. Meanwhile, SC-Earth inherits potential limitations such as inhomogeneity and precipitation undercatch from raw station data, which may affect its application in some cases. Overall, the high-quality and high-density SC-Earth dataset will benefit research in fields of hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and climate.

Probabilistic methods are useful to estimate the uncertainty in spatial meteorological fields (e.g., the uncertainty in spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature across large domains). In ensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members are used to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, of a spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the available information. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications. This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America (EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount, mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1∘ spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from a fusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The station data used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America (SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements using multiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded, corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimal interpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates. EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated random fields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) the merged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates, particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimates are more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regression estimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident in sparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performance according to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. We discuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that further research is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall, EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorological applications in North America.

Methane (CH4) emissions from natural landscapes constitute roughly half of global CH4 contributions to the atmosphere, yet large uncertainties remain in the absolute magnitude and the seasonality of emission quantities and drivers. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20∘ S to 20∘ N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021). Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters can be downloaded from https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/ (last access: 7 April 2021), and a complete list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 of this paper.</abstract><url hash="5e5399b3">G21-67002</url><pages>3607-3689</pages><doi>10.5194/essd-13-3607-2021</doi><bibkey>Delwiche-2021-FLUXNET-CH&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;4&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;:</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="68"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, Volume 126, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Simulating the Impact of Global Reservoir Expansion on the Present‐Day Climate</title><author><first>I.</first><last>Vanderkelen</last></author><author><first>N.

Yet very little is known about the impacts of reservoir expansion on the climate. Here, we implement reservoir construction in the Community Land Model by enabling dynamical lake area changes, while conserving mass and energy. Transient global lake and reservoir extent are prescribed from the HydroLAKES and Global Reservoir and Dam databases. Land-only simulations covering the 20th century with reservoir expansion enabled, highlight increases in terrestrial water storage and decreases in albedo matching the increase in open water area. The comparison of coupled simulations including and excluding reservoirs shows only limited influence of reservoirs on global temperatures and the surface energy balance, but demonstrates substantial responses locally, in particular where reservoirs make up a large fraction of the grid cell. In those locations, reservoirs dampen the diurnal temperature range by up to −1.5 K (for reservoirs covering &gt;15% of the grid cell), reduce temperature extremes, and moderate the seasonal temperature cycle.

In situ measurements of water equivalent of snow cover (SWE) – the vertical depth of water that would be obtained if all the snow cover melted completely – are used in many applications including water management, flood forecasting, climate monitoring, and evaluation of hydrological and land surface models. The Canadian historical SWE dataset (CanSWE) combines manual and automated pan-Canadian SWE observations collected by national, provincial and territorial agencies as well as hydropower companies. Snow depth (SD) and bulk snow density (defined as the ratio of SWE to SD) are also included when available. This new dataset supersedes the previous Canadian Historical Snow Survey (CHSSD) dataset published by Brown et al. (2019), and this paper describes the efforts made to correct metadata, remove duplicate observations and quality control records. The CanSWE dataset was compiled from 15 different sources and includes SWE information for all provinces and territories that measure SWE.

Regridding precipitation datasets is common for model coupling (e.g., coupling atmospheric and hydrological models) or comparing different models and datasets. However, regridding can considerably alter precipitation statistics. In this global analysis, the effects of regridding a precipitation dataset are emphasized using three regridding methods (first order conservative, bilinear, and distance weighted averaging). The differences between the original and regridded dataset are substantial and greatest at high quantiles. Differences of 46 mm and 0.13 mm are noted in high (0.95) and low (0.05) quantiles respectively. The impacts of regridding vary spatially for land and oceanic regions; there are substantial differences at high quantiles in tropical land regions, and at low quantiles in polar regions. These impacts are approximately the same for different regridding methods. The differences increase with the size of the grid at higher quantiles and vice versa for low quantiles. As the grid resolution increases, the difference between original and regridded data declines, yet the shift size dominates for high quantiles for which the differences are higher. Whilst regridding is often necessary to use gridded precipitation datasets, it should be used with great caution for fine resolutions (e.g., daily and sub-daily), as it can severely alter the statistical properties of precipitation, specifically at high and low quantiles.</abstract><url hash="67edd900">G21-70001</url><doi>10.1175/jamc-d-20-0259.1</doi><bibkey>Rajulapati-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="71"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrology, Volume 603</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Advances in the simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold climate agricultural basins: Developing new nitrogen and phosphorus modules for the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform</title><author><first>Diogo</first><last>Costa</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Tom</first><last>Brown</last></author><author><first>Helen</first><last>Baulch</last></author><author><first>Jane</first><last>Elliott</last></author><author><first>Merrin</first><last>Macrae</last></author><abstract>• Application of popular catchment nutrient models is problematic in cold regions. • New nutrient modules have been developed for the Cold Regions Hydrological Model. • The model was applied to a sub-basin of the increasingly eutrophic Lake Winnipeg, Canada. • Simulated SWE, discharge, NO3, NH4, SRP and partP were compared against observations. • Typical ∼9 day-freshet accounted for 16–31% of the total annual nutrient load. Excess nutrients in aquatic ecosystems is a major water quality problem globally. Worsening eutrophication issues are notable in cold temperate areas, with pervasive problems in many agriculturally dominated catchments. Predicting nutrient export to rivers and lakes is particularly difficult in cold agricultural environments because of challenges in modelling snow, soil, frozen ground, climate, and anthropogenic controls. Previous research has shown that the use of many popular small basin nutrient models can be problematic in cold regions due to poor representation of cold region hydrology. In this study, the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM), a modular modelling system, which has been widely deployed across Canada and cold regions worldwide, was used to address this problem. CRHM was extended to simulate biogeochemical and transport processes for nitrogen and phosphorus through a complex of new process-based modules that represent physicochemical processes in snow, soil and freshwater. Agricultural practices such as tillage and fertilizer application, which strongly impact the availability and release of soil nutrients, can be explicitly represented in the model. A test case in an agricultural basin draining towards Lake Winnipeg shows that the model can capture the extreme hydrology and nutrient load variability of small agricultural basins at hourly time steps. It was demonstrated that fine temporal resolutions are an essential modelling requisite to capture strong concentration changes in agricultural tributaries in cold agricultural environments. Within these ephemeral and intermittent streams, on average, 30%, 31%, 20%, and 16% of the total annual load of nitrate (NO 3 ), ammonium (NH 4 ), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and particulate phosphorous (partP)NO 3 , NH 4 , SRP and partP occurred during the episodic snowmelt freshet ( ∼ 9 days, accounting for 21% of the annual flow), but shows extreme temporal variation. The new nutrient modules are critical tools for predicting nutrient export from small agricultural drainage basins in cold climates via better representation of key hydrological processes, and a temporal resolution more suited to capture dynamics of ephemeral and intermittent streams.</abstract><url hash="df51be65">G21-71001</url><pages>126901</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126901</doi><bibkey>Costa-2021-Advances</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>A streamflow-oriented ranking-based methodological framework to combine multiple precipitation datasets across large river basins</title><author><first>Jefferson S.</first><last>Wong</last></author><author><first>Fuad</first><last>Yassin</last></author><author><first>James S.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>• A methodological framework to combine multiple precipitation products is proposed. • Hybrid datasets based on hydrological evaluation improve hydrological modelling. • Considering seasonal characteristics of the river basin enhance model performance. Hydrologic-Land Surface Models (H-LSMs) are subject to input uncertainties arising from climate forcing data, especially precipitation. For better streamflow simulations and predictions, the generation of a hybrid dataset by combining existing precipitation products has attracted considerable interest in recent years. To assess the accuracy of the hybrid dataset, in-situ precipitation-gauge stations are used as a reference point. However, the robustness of the hybrid dataset in representing spatial details can be problematic when the evaluation uses only a sparse network of in-situ observations at regional or basin scales. This study aims to develop a methodological framework to generate hybrid precipitation datasets based on the model performance of streamflow simulations that are spatially representative across large river basins. The framework is illustrated using a Canadian H-LSM known as MESH (Modélisation Environmentale communautaire – Surface Hydrology) in the Saskatchewan River basin, Canada, for the period 2002–2010. Five regional and global precipitation products (Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset at Princeton University (Princeton); the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to the ERA-Interim (WFDEI) augmented by Climatic Research Unit (WFDEI [CRU]) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (WFDEI [GPCC]); North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR); and Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA)) were included as candidates in this study. Results indicate that the generation of a hybrid dataset based on hydrological evaluation was useful for improving H-LSM modelling skills. Hybrid datasets showed a similar or better model performance compared to that of the best basin-wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually performed better downstream and at the basin outlet. When multiple products are combined model performance can be further enhanced by considering seasonality with respect to the hydrological regime of the river basin. This study demonstrates the usefulness of hybrid datasets in a large-scale river basin with low climate station network density.</abstract><url hash="4658efdf">G21-71002</url><pages>127174</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127174</doi><bibkey>Wong-2021-A</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="72"><meta><booktitle>Global Change Biology, Volume 28, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Joint effects of climate, tree size, and year on annual tree growth derived from tree‐ring records of ten globally distributed forests</title><author><first>Kristina J.</first><last>Anderson‐Teixeira</last></author><author><first>Valentine</first><last>Herrmann</last></author><author><first>Christine R.</first><last>Rollinson</last></author><author><first>Bianca</first><last>Gonzalez</last></author><author><first>Erika B.</first><last>Gonzalez‐Akre</last></author><author><first>Neil</first><last>Pederson</last></author><author><first>M.

However, conventional tree-ring analysis methods were not designed to simultaneously test effects of climate, tree size, and other drivers on individual growth. This has limited the potential to test ecologically relevant hypotheses on tree growth sensitivity to environmental drivers and their interactions with tree size. Here, we develop and apply a new method to simultaneously model nonlinear effects of primary climate drivers, reconstructed tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and calendar year in generalized least squares models that account for the temporal autocorrelation inherent to each individual tree's growth. We analyze data from 3811 trees representing 40 species at 10 globally distributed sites, showing that precipitation, temperature, DBH, and calendar year have additively, and often interactively, influenced annual growth over the past 120 years. Growth responses were predominantly positive to precipitation (usually over ≥3-month seasonal windows) and negative to temperature (usually maximum temperature, over ≤3-month seasonal windows), with concave-down responses in 63% of relationships. Climate sensitivity commonly varied with DBH (45% of cases tested), with larger trees usually more sensitive. Trends in ring width at small DBH were linked to the light environment under which trees established, but basal area or biomass increments consistently reached maxima at intermediate DBH. Accounting for climate and DBH, growth rate declined over time for 92% of species in secondary or disturbed stands, whereas growth trends were mixed in older forests. These trends were largely attributable to stand dynamics as cohorts and stands age, which remain challenging to disentangle from global change drivers. By providing a parsimonious approach for characterizing multiple interacting drivers of tree growth, our method reveals a more complete picture of the factors influencing growth than has previously been possible.</abstract><url hash="cde4118b">G21-72001</url><pages>245-266</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15934</doi><bibkey>Anderson‐Teixeira-2021-Joint</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="73"><meta><booktitle>Limnology and Oceanography Letters, Volume 6, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>&lt;scp&gt;Size‐based&lt;/scp&gt;

In boreal North America, black spruce shapes forest flammability and depends on fire for regeneration. This relationship has helped black spruce maintain its dominance through much of the Holocene. However, with climate change and more frequent and severe fires, shifts away from black spruce dominance to broadleaf or pine species are emerging, with implications for ecosystem functions including carbon sequestration, water and energy fluxes, and wildlife habitat. Here, we predict that such reductions in black spruce after fire may already be widespread given current trends in climate and fire. To test this, we synthesize data from 1,538 field sites across boreal North America to evaluate compositional changes in tree species following 58 recent fires (1989 to 2014). While black spruce was resilient following most fires (62%), loss of resilience was common, and spruce regeneration failed completely in 18% of 1,140 black spruce sites. In contrast, postfire regeneration never failed in forests dominated by jack pine, which also possesses an aerial seed bank, or broad-leaved trees. More complete combustion of the soil organic layer, which often occurs in better-drained landscape positions and in dryer duff, promoted compositional changes throughout boreal North America. Forests in western North America, however, were more vulnerable to change due to greater long-term climate moisture deficits. While we find considerable remaining resilience in black spruce forests, predicted increases in climate moisture deficits and fire activity will erode this resilience, pushing the system toward a tipping point that has not been crossed in several thousand years.</abstract><url hash="e88f4e57">G21-74001</url><doi>10.1073/pnas.2024872118</doi><bibkey>Baltzer-2021-Increasing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="75"><meta><booktitle>New Phytologist, Volume 231, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Seasonal thaw and landscape position determine foliar functional traits and whole‐plant water use in tall shrubs on the low arctic tundra</title><author><first>Katherine L.</first><last>Black</last></author><author><first>Cory A.</first><last>Wallace</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Climate warming is driving tundra shrub expansion with implications for ecosystem function and regional climate. Understanding associations between shrub ecophysiological function, distribution and environment is necessary for predicting consequences of expansion. We evaluated the role of topographic gradients on upland shrub productivity to understand potential constraints on shrub expansion. At a low arctic tundra site near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, we measured sap flow, stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits in green alder, and environmental predictors (water and nutrient availability and seasonal thaw depth) across a toposequence in alder patches. Seasonal thaw reduced stem sap flow whereas topographic position predicted stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits. Upslope shrubs were more water-limited than those downslope. Shrubs in drainage channels had traits associated with greater productivity than those on the tops of slopes. The effect of thaw depth on sap flow has implications for seasonal water-use patterns and warming impacts on tundra ecohydrology. Topographic variation in functional traits corresponds with observed spatial patterns of tundra shrub expansion along floodplains and concave hillslopes rather than in upland areas. Green alder is expanding rapidly across the low arctic tundra in northwestern North America; thus, anticipating the implications of its expansion is essential for predicting tundra function.</abstract><url hash="50332932">G21-75001</url><pages>94-107</pages><doi>10.1111/nph.17375</doi><bibkey>Black-2021-Seasonal</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="76"><meta><booktitle>Nature Communications, Volume 12, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Substantial hysteresis in emergent temperature sensitivity of global wetland CH4 emissions</title><author><first>Kuang-Yu</first><last>Chang</last></author><author><first>William J.</first><last>Riley</last></author><author><first>Sara H.</first><last>Knox</last></author><author><first>Robert B.</first><last>Jackson</last></author><author><first>Gavin</first><last>McNicol</last></author><author><first>Benjamin</first><last>Poulter</last></author><author><first>Mika</first><last>Aurela</last></author><author><first>Dennis</first><last>Baldocchi</last></author><author><first>Sheel</first><last>Bansal</last></author><author><first>Gil</first><last>Bohrer</last></author><author><first>David I.</first><last>Campbell</last></author><author><first>Alessandro</first><last>Cescatti</last></author><author><first>Housen</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>Kyle B.</first><last>Delwiche</last></author><author><first>Ankur R.</first><last>Desai</last></author><author><first>Eugenie</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>Thomas</first><last>Friborg</last></author><author><first>Mathias</first><last>Goeckede</last></author><author><first>Manuel</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>Kyle S.</first><last>Hemes</last></author><author><first>Takashi</first><last>Hirano</last></author><author><first>Hiroki</first><last>Iwata</last></author><author><first>Minseok</first><last>Kang</last></author><author><first>Trevor</first><last>Keenan</last></author><author><first>Ken W.</first><last>Krauss</last></author><author><first>Annalea</first><last>Lohila</last></author><author><first>Ivan</first><last>Mammarella</last></author><author><first>Bhaskar</first><last>Mitra</last></author><author><first>Akira</first><last>Miyata</last></author><author><first>Mats B.</first><last>Nilsson</last></author><author><first>Asko</first><last>Noormets</last></author><author><first>Walter C.</first><last>Oechel</last></author><author><first>Dario</first><last>Papale</last></author><author><first>Matthias</first><last>Peichl</last></author><author><first>Michele L.</first><last>Reba</last></author><author><first>Janne</first><last>Rinne</last></author><author><first>Benjamin R.

Snowmelt constitutes a primary source of moisture supply for the short growing season and strongly influences stream hydrographs. Permafrost thaw has changed the landscape by increasing the proportional coverage of permafrost-free wetlands at the expense of permafrost-cored peat plateau forests. The biophysical characteristics of each feature affect snow water equivalent (SWE) accumulation and melt rates. In headwater streams in the southern Dehcho region of the NWT, snowmelt runoff has significantly increased over the past 50 years, despite no significant change in annual SWE. At the Fort Simpson A climate station, we found that SWE measurements made by Environment and Climate Change Canada using a Nipher precipitation gauge were more accurate than the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Dataset which was derived from snow depth measurements. Here, we: (a) provide 13 years of snow survey data to demonstrate differences in end-of-season SWE between wetlands and plateau forests; (b) provide ablation stake and radiation measurements to document differences in snow melt patterns among wetlands, plateau forests, and upland forests; and (c) evaluate the potential impact of permafrost-thaw induced wetland expansion on SWE accumulation, melt, and runoff. We found that plateaus retain significantly (p &lt; 0.01) more SWE than wetlands. However, the differences are too small (123 mm and 111 mm, respectively) to cause any substantial change in basin SWE. During the snowmelt period in 2015, wetlands were the first feature to become snow-free in mid-April, followed by plateau forests (7 days after wetlands) and upland forests (18 days after wetlands). A transition to a higher percentage cover of wetlands may lead to more rapid snowmelt and provide a more hydrologically-connected landscape, a plausible mechanism driving the observed increase in spring freshet runoff.</abstract><url hash="fa3ae1b9">G21-77001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14363</doi><bibkey>Connon-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="78"><meta><booktitle>Freshwater Biology, Volume 67, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Arctic freshwater biodiversity: Establishing baselines, trends, and drivers of ecological change</title><author><first>Joseph M.</first><last>Culp</last></author><author><first>Willem</first><last>Goedkoop</last></author><author><first>Tom</first><last>Christensen</last></author><author><first>Kirsten S.</first><last>Christoffersen</last></author><author><first>Elena</first><last>Fefilova</last></author><author><first>Petri</first><last>Liljaniemi</last></author><author><first>Anna A.</first><last>Novichkova</last></author><author><first>Jón S.</first><last>Ólafsson</last></author><author><first>Steinar</first><last>Sandøy</last></author><author><first>Christian E.</first><last>Zimmerman</last></author><author><first>Jennifer</first><last>Lento</last></author><abstract>Climate change is predicted to have dramatic effects on Arctic freshwater ecosystems through changes to the abiotic template that are expected to influence biodiversity. Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program–Freshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program–Freshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers. This special issue includes regional patterns for selected groups of organisms in Arctic rivers and lakes of northern Europe, Russia, and North America. Circumpolar assessments for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, plankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish demonstrate how climate change and associated environmental drivers affect freshwater biodiversity. Also included are papers on spatial and temporal trends in water chemistry across the circumpolar region, and a systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge that demonstrates its potential to support assessment and conservation of Arctic freshwaters. This special issue includes the first circumpolar assessment of trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity and provides important baseline information for future assessments and studies. It represents the largest compilation and assessment of Arctic freshwater biodiversity data to date and strives to provide a holistic view of ongoing change in these ecosystems to support future monitoring efforts. By identifying gaps in monitoring data across the circumpolar region, as well as identifying best practices for monitoring and assessment, this special issue presents an important resource for researchers, policy makers, and Indigenous and local communities that can support future assessments of ecosystem change.</abstract><url hash="a259f1ef">G21-78001</url><pages>1-13</pages><doi>10.1111/fwb.13831</doi><bibkey>Culp-2021-Arctic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="79"><meta><booktitle>Global Change Biology, Volume 27, Issue 12</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Unexpected greening in a boreal permafrost peatland undergoing forest loss is partially attributable to tree species turnover</title><author><first>Katherine D.</first><last>Dearborn</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery are useful in measuring vegetation response to climate warming in remote northern regions. These indices show that productivity is generally declining in the boreal forest, but it is unclear which components of boreal vegetation are driving these trends. We aimed to compare trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to forest growth and demographic data taken from a 10 ha mapped plot located in a spruce-dominated boreal peatland. We used microcores to quantify recent growth trends and tree census data to characterize mortality and recruitment rates of the three dominant tree species. We then compared spatial patterns in growth and demography to patterns in Landsat-derived maximum NDVI trends (1984-2019) in 78 pixels that fell within the plot. We found that NDVI trends were predominantly positive (i.e., greening) in spite of the ongoing loss of black spruce (the dominant species; 80% of stems) from the plot. The magnitude of these trends correlated positively with black spruce growth trends, but was also governed to a large extent by tree mortality and recruitment. Greening trends were weaker (lower slope) in areas with high larch mortality, and high turnover of spruce and birch, but stronger (higher slope) in areas with high larch recruitment. Larch dominance is currently low (~11% of stems), but it is increasing in abundance as permafrost thaw progresses and will likely have a substantial influence on future NDVI trends. Our results emphasize that NDVI trends in boreal peatlands can be positive even when the forest as a whole is in decline, and that the magnitude of trends can be strongly influenced by the demographics of uncommon species.</abstract><url hash="1ae5968a">G21-79001</url><pages>2867-2882</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15608</doi><bibkey>Dearborn-2021-Unexpected</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="80"><meta><booktitle>Science of The Total Environment, Volume 760</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Human biomonitoring results of contaminant and nutrient biomarkers in Old Crow, Yukon, Canada</title><author><first>Mallory</first><last>Drysdale</last></author><author><first>Mylene</first><last>Ratelle</last></author><author><first>Kelly</first><last>Skinner</last></author><author><first>Joshua</first><last>Garcia-Barrios</last></author><author><first>Mary</first><last>Gamberg</last></author><author><first>Megan</first><last>Williams</last></author><author><first>Shannon</first><last>Majowicz</last></author><author><first>Michele</first><last>Bouchard</last></author><author><first>Ken</first><last>Stark</last></author><author><first>Dan</first><last>Chalil</last></author><author><first>Brian D.</first><last>Laird</last></author><abstract>Several large-scale human biomonitoring projects have been conducted in Canada, including the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI). However, neither of these studies included participants living in the Yukon. To address this data gap, a human biomonitoring project was implemented in Old Crow, a fly-in Gwich'in community in the northern Yukon. The results of this project provide baseline levels of contaminant and nutrient biomarkers from Old Crow in 2019. Samples of hair, blood, and/or urine were collected from approximately 44% of community residents (77 of 175 adults). These samples were analyzed for contaminants (including heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs)), and nutrients (including trace elements and omega-3 fatty acids). Levels of these analytes were compared to health-based guidance values, when available, and results from other human biomonitoring projects in Canada. Levels of lead (GM 0.64 μg/g creatinine in urine/24 μg/L blood), cadmium (GM 0.32 μg/g creatinine in urine/0.85 μg/L blood), and mercury (GM &lt; LOD in urine/0.76 μg/L blood/0.31 μg/g hair) were below select health-based guidance values for more than 95% of participants. However, compared to the general Canadian population, elevated levels of some contaminants, including lead (approximately 2× higher), cobalt (approximately 1.5× higher), manganese (approximately 1.3× higher), and hexachlorobenzene (approximately 1.5× higher) were observed. In contrast, levels of other POPs, including insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), its metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were similar to, or lower than, those reported in the general Canadian population. This study can be used along with future biomonitoring programs to evaluate the effectiveness of international initiatives designed to reduce the contaminant burden in the Arctic, including the Stockholm Convention and the Minamata Convention. Regionally, this project complements environmental monitoring being conducted in the region, informing local and regional traditional food consumption advisories.</abstract><url hash="e5bd4ed1">G21-80001</url><pages>143339</pages><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143339</doi><bibkey>Drysdale-2021-Human</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="81"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, Volume 235</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Biomarkers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in Sub-Arctic and Arctic communities in Canada</title><author><first>Joshua</first><last>Garcia-Barrios</last></author><author><first>Mallory</first><last>Drysdale</last></author><author><first>Mylène</first><last>Ratelle</last></author><author><first>Éric</first><last>Gaudreau</last></author><author><first>Alain</first><last>LeBlanc</last></author><author><first>Mary</first><last>Gamberg</last></author><author><first>Brian D.</first><last>Laird</last></author><abstract>Polyfluoroalkyl substances and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of anthropogenic chemicals that are used in food packaging, waterproof clothing, and firefighting foams for their water and oil resistant properties. Though levels of some PFAS appear to be decreasing in Canada's south, environmental levels have been increasing in the Arctic due to long-range transport. However, the implications of this on human exposures in sub-Arctic and Arctic populations in Canada have yet to be established. To address this data gap, human biomonitoring research was completed in Old Crow, Yukon, and the Dehcho region, Northwest Territories. Blood samples were collected from adults residing in seven northern First Nations and were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A total of nine PFAS were quantified: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulphonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluorobutane sulphonic acid (PFBS). In the Dehcho (n = 124), five PFAS had a detection rate greater than 50% including PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA. In addition to these PFAS, PFUdA was also detected in at least half of the samples collected in Old Crow (n = 54). Generally, male participants had higher concentrations of PFAS compared to female participants, and PFAS concentrations tended to increase with age. For most PFAS, Old Crow and Dehcho levels were similar or lower to those measured in the general Canadian population (as measured through the Canadian Health Measures Survey or CHMS) and other First Nations populations in Canada (as measured through the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative or FNBI). The key exception to this was for PFNA which, relative to the CHMS (0.51 μg/L), was approximately 1.8 times higher in Old Crow (0.94 μg/L) and 2.8 times higher in Dehcho (1.42 μg/L) than observed in the general Canadian population. This project provides baseline PFAS levels for participating communities, improving understanding of human exposures to PFAS in Canada. Future research should investigate site-specific PFNA exposure sources and monitor temporal trends in these regions.</abstract><url hash="5d0129b4">G21-81001</url><pages>113754</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113754</doi><bibkey>Garcia-Barrios-2021-Biomarkers</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="82"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Research Letters, Volume 16, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>IOP Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Mapping and understanding the vulnerability of northern peatlands to permafrost thaw at scales relevant to community adaptation planning</title><author><first>C</first><last>Gibson</last></author><author><first>K</first><last>Cottenie</last></author><author><first>T</first><last>Gingras-Hill</last></author><author><first>S V</first><last>Kokelj</last></author><author><first>J L</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>L</first><last>Chasmer</last></author><author><first>M R</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><abstract>Abstract Developing spatially explicit permafrost datasets and climate assessments at scales relevant to northern communities is increasingly important as land users and decision makers incorporate changing permafrost conditions in community and adaptation planning. This need is particularly strong within the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Northwest Territories (NWT) Canada where permafrost peatlands are undergoing rapid thaw due to a warming climate. Current data products for predicting landscapes at risk of thaw are generally built at circumpolar scales and do not lend themselves well to fine-scale regional interpretations. Here, we present a new permafrost vulnerability dataset that assesses the degree of permafrost thaw within peatlands across a 750 km latitudinal gradient in the NWT. This updated dataset provides spatially explicit estimates of where peatland thermokarst potential exists, thus making it much more suitable for local, regional or community usage. Within southern peatland complexes, we show that permafrost thaw affects up to 70% of the peatland area and that thaw is strongly mediated by both latitude and elevation, with widespread thaw occuring particularly at low elevations. At the northern end of our latitudinal gradient, peatland permafrost remains climate-protected with relatively little thaw. Collectively these results demonstrate the importance of scale in permafrost analyses and mapping if research is to support northern communities and decision makers in a changing climate. This study offers a more scale-appropriate approach to support community adaptative planning under scenarios of continued warming and widespread permafrost thaw.</abstract><url hash="4fb4865a">G21-82001</url><pages>055022</pages><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/abe74b</doi><bibkey>Gibson-2021-Mapping</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="83"><meta><booktitle>Methods in Ecology and Evolution, Volume 13, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>&lt;i&gt;allodb&lt;/i&gt;

Here we present an integrated R package, allodb, containing systematically selected published allometric equations and proposed functions to compute AGB. The data component of the package is based on 701 woody species identified at 24 large Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) forest dynamics plots representing a wide diversity of extratropical forests. A total of 570 parsed allometric equations to estimate individual tree biomass were retrieved, checked and combined using a weighting function designed to ensure optimal equation selection over the full tree size range with smooth transitions across equations. The equation dataset can be customized with built-in functions that subset the original dataset and add new equations. Although equations were curated based on a limited set of forest communities and number of species, this resource is appropriate for large portions of the global extratropics and can easily be expanded to cover novel forest types.</abstract><url hash="f708e13f">G21-83001</url><pages>330-338</pages><doi>10.1111/2041-210x.13756</doi><bibkey>Gonzalez‐Akre-2021-&lt;i&gt;allodb&lt;/i&gt;</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="84"><meta><booktitle>Ecosphere, Volume 12, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Predicting patterns of terrestrial lichen biomass recovery following boreal wildfires</title><author><first>Ruth J.</first><last>Greuel</last></author><author><first>Geneviève É.</first><last>Degré‐Timmons</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>Jill F.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>Eliot J.

Early successional forests have been shown to support lower quantities of caribou forage lichens, but geographic variation in, and controls on, the rates of lichen recovery has been largely unexplored. In this study, we sampled across a broad region in northwestern Canada to compare lichen biomass accumulation in ecoprovinces, including the Saskatchewan Boreal Shield, the Northwest Territories Taiga Shield, and Northwest Territories Taiga Plains, divided into North and South. We focused on the most valuable Cladonia species for boreal and barren-ground caribou: Cladonia mitis and C. arbuscula, C. rangiferina and C. stygia, and C. stellaris and C. uncialis. We developed new allometric equations to estimate lichen biomass from field measurements of lichen cover and height; allometries were consistent among ecoprovinces, suggesting generalizability. We then used estimates of lichen biomass to quantify patterns of lichen recovery in different stand types, ecoprovinces, and with time following stand-replacing fire. We used a hurdle model to account both for the heterogeneous nature of lichen presence (zero inflation) and for the range of abundance in stands where lichen was present. The first component of the hurdle model, a generalized linear model, identified stand age, stand type, and ecoprovince as significant predictors of lichen presence. With a logistic growth model, a measure of lichen recovery (time to 50% asymptotic value) varied from 28 to 73 yr, dependent on stand type and ecoprovince. The combined predictions of the hurdle model suggest the most rapid recovery of lichen biomass across our study region occurred in jack pine in the Boreal Shield (30 yr), while stands located in the Taiga Plains (North and South) required a longer recovery period (approximately 75 yr). These results provide a basis for estimating future caribou habitat that encompasses some of the large variation in fire effects on lichen abundance and vegetation types across the range of boreal and barren-ground caribou in North America.</abstract><url hash="6adfd986">G21-84001</url><doi>10.1002/ecs2.3481</doi><bibkey>Greuel-2021-Predicting</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="85"><meta><booktitle>Biogeosciences, Volume 18, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>L-band vegetation optical depth as an indicator of plant water potential in a temperate deciduous forest stand</title><author><first>Nataniel M.</first><last>Holtzman</last></author><author><first>Leander D.

Vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrieved from microwave radiometry correlates with the total amount of water in vegetation, based on theoretical and empirical evidence. Because the total amount of water in vegetation varies with relative water content (as well as with biomass), this correlation further suggests a possible relationship between VOD and plant water potential, a quantity that drives plant hydraulic behavior. Previous studies have found evidence for that relationship on the scale of satellite pixels tens of kilometers across, but these comparisons suffer from significant scaling error. Here we used small-scale remote sensing to test the link between remotely sensed VOD and plant water potential. We placed an L-band radiometer on a tower above the canopy looking down at red oak forest stand during the 2019 growing season in central Massachusetts, United States. We measured stem xylem and leaf water potentials of trees within the stand and retrieved VOD with a single-channel algorithm based on continuous radiometer measurements and measured soil moisture. VOD exhibited a diurnal cycle similar to that of leaf and stem water potential, with a peak at approximately 05:00 eastern daylight time (UTC−4). VOD was also positively correlated with both the measured dielectric constant and water potentials of stem xylem over the growing season. The presence of moisture on the leaves did not affect the observed relationship between VOD and stem water potential. We used our observed VOD–water-potential relationship to estimate stand-level values for a radiative transfer parameter and a plant hydraulic parameter, which compared well with the published literature. Our findings support the use of VOD for plant hydraulic studies in temperate forests.</abstract><url hash="d263bee3">G21-85001</url><pages>739-753</pages><doi>10.5194/bg-18-739-2021</doi><bibkey>Holtzman-2021-L-band</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="86"><meta><booktitle>Advances in Water Resources, Volume 154</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Coupled model for water, vapour, heat, stress and strain fields in variably saturated freezing soils</title><author><first>Xiang</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>David L.</first><last>Rudolph</last></author><abstract>• Coupled modelling of water flow, heat transfer, water-ice phase change and ice lens formation in deformable, variably saturated freezing soils. • Moisture, vapour, temperature and stress-strain fields significantly interact with each other and should be fully accounted for within the modeling platform. • The large increases in effective stress ahead of the freezing front causes substantial compaction in the unfrozen zone. Although many frost heave and freezing soil models have been developed in the past decades, saturated conditions are commonly assumed and/or the behavior of pore ice rather than ice lenses are conventionally predicted. This study presents a fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) model for variably saturated freezing soil, which examines a number of processes. These include heat conduction and convection, phase change, water (moisture) movement through cryosuction, and the development of independent ice lenses. Instead of directly solving for the pore pressure distributions, the void ratio is considered as a dependent variable related to the degree of water saturation. Both the stress-deformation and ice lens segregation are inextricably linked to the evolution of the void ratio as well. The coupled mechanism and performance of the model is first verified by comparison with laboratory freezing experiment observations obtained from literature and then is further evaluated by a series of parametric analyses. The results show that the calculated profiles of temperature, water content and frost heave are in good agreement with literature experimental data, demonstrating that the proposed THM coupling model appropriately represents the mechanisms of heat-moisture-deformation in variably saturated freezing soil. In addition, the sensitivity analysis illustrates that in the test cases considered, thermally-induced cryosuction due to phase change is the main driving force for water migrating towards the freezing front. Also, ahead of the freezing front, a significant increase in effective stress developed due to the elevated negative pore pressure and expansion of ice lenses causing substantial consolidation and reduction in porosity in the unfrozen zone. As the freezing front penetrated with time, the temperature, moisture, vapour and stress-strain fields interact with each other. The distribution of water vapour was mainly controlled by the temperature gradient and location of the freezing front. Both the initial degree of saturation and hydraulic conductivity affected the distribution of pore pressure and displacements. Higher compression moduli and lower overburden load led to greater frost heave but exerted little influence on the temperature field. Finally, the two-sided freezing scenario for soils underlain by permafrost made the middle ice-poor zone highly compacted with ice lenses accumulating near both freezing boundaries.</abstract><url hash="c0d6110d">G21-86001</url><pages>103945</pages><doi>10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.103945</doi><bibkey>Huang-2021-Coupled</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="87"><meta><booktitle>Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volume 308-309</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Gap-filling eddy covariance methane fluxes: Comparison of machine learning model predictions and uncertainties at FLUXNET-CH4 wetlands</title><author><first>Jeremy</first><last>Irvin</last></author><author><first>Sharon</first><last>Zhou</last></author><author><first>Gavin</first><last>McNicol</last></author><author><first>Fred</first><last>Lu</last></author><author><first>Vincent</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Etienne</first><last>Fluet-Chouinard</last></author><author><first>Zutao</first><last>Ouyang</last></author><author><first>Sara Helen</first><last>Knox</last></author><author><first>Antje</first><last>Lucas-Moffat</last></author><author><first>Carlo</first><last>Trotta</last></author><author><first>Dario</first><last>Papale</last></author><author><first>Domenico</first><last>Vitale</last></author><author><first>Ivan</first><last>Mammarella</last></author><author><first>Pavel</first><last>Alekseychik</last></author><author><first>Mika</first><last>Aurela</last></author><author><first>Anand</first><last>Avati</last></author><author><first>Dennis</first><last>Baldocchi</last></author><author><first>Sheel</first><last>Bansal</last></author><author><first>Gil</first><last>Bohrer</last></author><author><first>David I</first><last>Campbell</last></author><author><first>Jiquan</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Housen</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>Higo J</first><last>Dalmagro</last></author><author><first>Kyle B</first><last>Delwiche</last></author><author><first>Ankur R</first><last>Desai</last></author><author><first>Eugenie</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>Sarah</first><last>Feron</last></author><author><first>Mathias</first><last>Goeckede</last></author><author><first>Martin</first><last>Heimann</last></author><author><first>Manuel</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>Carole</first><last>Helfter</last></author><author><first>Kyle S</first><last>Hemes</last></author><author><first>Takashi</first><last>Hirano</last></author><author><first>Hiroki</first><last>Iwata</last></author><author><first>Gerald</first><last>Jurasinski</last></author><author><first>Aram</first><last>Kalhori</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Kondrich</last></author><author><first>Derrick YF</first><last>Lai</last></author><author><first>Annalea</first><last>Lohila</last></author><author><first>Avni</first><last>Malhotra</last></author><author><first>Lutz</first><last>Merbold</last></author><author><first>Bhaskar</first><last>Mitra</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Ng</last></author><author><first>Mats B</first><last>Nilsson</last></author><author><first>Asko</first><last>Noormets</last></author><author><first>Matthias</first><last>Peichl</last></author><author><first>A.

Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).</abstract><url hash="786a7668">G21-87001</url><pages>108528</pages><doi>10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108528</doi><bibkey>Irvin-2021-Gap-filling</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="88"><meta><booktitle>The Cryosphere, Volume 15, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Snow water equivalent measurement in the Arctic based on cosmic ray neutron attenuation</title><author><first>Anton</first><last>Jitnikovitch</last></author><author><first>Philip</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>Branden</first><last>Walker</last></author><author><first>Darin</first><last>Desilets</last></author><abstract>Abstract. Grounded in situ, or invasive, cosmic ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) may allow for continuous, unattended measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) over complete winter seasons and allow for measurements that are representative of spatially variable Arctic snow covers, but few studies have tested these types of sensors or considered their applicability at remote sites in the Arctic. During the winters of 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 we tested a grounded in situ CRNS system at two locations in Canada: a cold, low- to high-SWE environment in the Canadian Arctic and at a warm, low-SWE landscape in southern Ontario that allowed easier access for validation purposes. Five CRNS units were applied in a transect to obtain continuous data for a single significant snow feature; CRNS-moderated neutron counts were compared to manual snow survey SWE values obtained during both winter seasons. The data indicate that grounded in situ CRNS instruments appear able to continuously measure SWE with sufficient accuracy utilizing both a linear regression and nonlinear formulation. These sensors can provide important SWE data for testing snow and hydrological models, water resource management applications, and the validation of remote sensing applications.</abstract><url hash="2009663e">G21-88001</url><pages>5227-5239</pages><doi>10.5194/tc-15-5227-2021</doi><bibkey>Jitnikovitch-2021-Snow</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="89"><meta><booktitle>Global Change Biology, Volume 27, Issue 15</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Identifying dominant environmental predictors of freshwater wetland methane fluxes across diurnal to seasonal time scales</title><author><first>Sara H.</first><last>Knox</last></author><author><first>Sheel</first><last>Bansal</last></author><author><first>Gavin</first><last>McNicol</last></author><author><first>Karina</first><last>Schafer</last></author><author><first>Cove</first><last>Sturtevant</last></author><author><first>Masahito</first><last>Ueyama</last></author><author><first>Alex C.</first><last>Valach</last></author><author><first>Dennis</first><last>Baldocchi</last></author><author><first>Kyle</first><last>Delwiche</last></author><author><first>Ankur R.</first><last>Desai</last></author><author><first>Eugenie</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>Jinxun</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Annalea</first><last>Lohila</last></author><author><first>Avni</first><last>Malhotra</last></author><author><first>Lulie</first><last>Melling</last></author><author><first>William</first><last>Riley</last></author><author><first>Benjamin R.

Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi-site synthesis of how predictors of CH4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet-based multi-resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (e.g., seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by ~17 ± 11 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8 ± 16 and 5 ± 15 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat-dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH4. At the diel scale, synchronous relationships with latent heat flux and vapor pressure deficit suggest that physical processes controlling evaporation and boundary layer mixing exert similar controls on CH4 volatilization, and suggest the influence of pressurized ventilation in aerenchymatous vegetation. In addition, 1- to 4-h lagged relationships with ecosystem photosynthesis indicate recent carbon substrates, such as root exudates, may also control FCH4. By addressing issues of scale, asynchrony, and nonlinearity, this work improves understanding of the predictors and timing of wetland FCH4 that can inform future studies and models, and help constrain wetland CH4 emissions.</abstract><url hash="98b5015b">G21-89001</url><pages>3582-3604</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15661</doi><bibkey>Knox-2021-Identifying</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="90"><meta><booktitle>The Cryosphere, Volume 15, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Invited perspective: What lies beneath a changing Arctic?</title><author><first>Jeffrey M.</first><last>McKenzie</last></author><author><first>Barret L.</first><last>Kurylyk</last></author><author><first>Michelle A.</first><last>Walvoord</last></author><author><first>Victor F.</first><last>Bense</last></author><author><first>Daniel</first><last>Fortier</last></author><author><first>Christopher</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>Christophe</first><last>Grenier</last></author><abstract>Abstract.

We identify different ways that these subsurface changes are driving observed surface consequences, including the potential for increased contaminant transport, modification to water resources, and enhanced rates of infrastructure (e.g. buildings and roads) damage. Further, as permafrost thaws it allows groundwater to transport carbon, nutrients, and other dissolved constituents from terrestrial to aquatic environments via progressively deeper subsurface flow paths.

Recent drawdown of the delta’s abundant shallow lakes and rivers has deteriorated vital habitat for wildlife and impaired navigation routes. Here, we report continuous measurements at ~50 lakes during open-water seasons of 2018 and 2019 to improve understanding of hydrological processes causing lake-level variation. Analyses reveal four patterns of lake-level variation attributable to influential hydrological processes, which provide the basis for a new lake classification scheme: 1) ‘Drawdown’ (≥15 cm decline) by evaporation and/or outflow after ice-jam floods, 2) ‘Stable’ lake levels (&lt;15 cm change) sustained by rainfall, 3) ‘Gradual Rise’ by inundation from the open-drainage network, and 4) ‘Rapid Rise’ by input of river floodwater. River flooding during the open-water season is an under-recognized recharge mechanism yet occurred extensively in the Athabasca sector and appears to be a common occurrence based on the Athabasca River hydrometric record. Lake-level loggers show strong ability to track shifts in hydrological processes, and can be integrated with other methods to decipher their causes and ecological consequences across water-rich landscapes. • Concerns over lake drying in the Peace-Athabasca Delta motivated this study. • Depth loggers captured lake-level responses to flooding, rainfall and evaporation. • Four patterns comprise a new classification scheme for lakes in the PAD. • Timing, magnitude and extent of open-water flooding was quantified. • Open-water season river flooding identified as an important recharge mechanism.</abstract><url hash="72d4afea">G21-92001</url><pages>100948</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100948</doi><bibkey>Neary-2021-A</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Application of artificial substrate samplers to assess enrichment of metals of concern by river floodwaters to lakes across the Peace-Athabasca Delta</title><author><first>Cory A.M.</first><last>Savage</last></author><author><first>Tanner</first><last>Owca</last></author><author><first>Mitchell L.</first><last>Kay</last></author><author><first>Jelle</first><last>Faber</last></author><author><first>Brent B.</first><last>Wolfe</last></author><author><first>Roland I.</first><last>Hall</last></author><abstract>Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), northeastern Alberta. Potential for downstream delivery of contaminants via Athabasca River floodwaters to lakes of the PAD has raised local to international concern. Here, we quantify enrichment of eight metals (Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in aquatic biota, relative to sediment-based pre-industrial baselines, via analysis of biofilm-sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers deployed during summers of 2017 and 2018 in &gt; 40 lakes. Widespread flooding in the southern portion of the delta in spring 2018 allows for assessment of metal enrichment by Athabasca River floodwaters. River floodwaters are not implicated as a pathway of metal enrichment to biofilm-sediment mixtures in PAD lakes from upstream sources. MANOVA tests revealed no significant difference in residual concentrations of all eight metals in lakes that did not flood versus lakes that flooded during one or both study years. Also, no enrichment was detected for concentrations of biologically inert metals (Be, Cr, Pb) and those related to oil-sands development (Ni, V). Enrichment of Cd, Cu, and Zn at non-flooded lakes, however, suggests uptake of biologically active metals complicates comparisons of organic-rich biofilm-sediment mixtures to sediment-derived baselines for these metals.

Methane emissions from boreal and arctic wetlands, lakes, and rivers are expected to increase in response to warming and associated permafrost thaw. However, the lack of appropriate land cover datasets for scaling field-measured methane emissions to circumpolar scales has contributed to a large uncertainty for our understanding of present-day and future methane emissions. Here we present the Boreal–Arctic Wetland and Lake Dataset (BAWLD), a land cover dataset based on an expert assessment, extrapolated using random forest modelling from available spatial datasets of climate, topography, soils, permafrost conditions, vegetation, wetlands, and surface water extents and dynamics. In BAWLD, we estimate the fractional coverage of five wetland, seven lake, and three river classes within 0.5 × 0.5∘ grid cells that cover the northern boreal and tundra biomes (17 % of the global land surface). Land cover classes were defined using criteria that ensured distinct methane emissions among classes, as indicated by a co-developed comprehensive dataset of methane flux observations. In BAWLD, wetlands occupied 3.2 × 106 km2 (14 % of domain) with a 95 % confidence interval between 2.8 and 3.8 × 106 km2. Bog, fen, and permafrost bog were the most abundant wetland classes, covering ∼ 28 % each of the total wetland area, while the highest-methane-emitting marsh and tundra wetland classes occupied 5 % and 12 %, respectively. Lakes, defined to include all lentic open-water ecosystems regardless of size, covered 1.4 × 106 km2 (6 % of domain). Low-methane-emitting large lakes (&amp;gt;10 km2) and glacial lakes jointly represented 78 % of the total lake area, while high-emitting peatland and yedoma lakes covered 18 % and 4 %, respectively. Small (&amp;lt;0.1 km2) glacial, peatland, and yedoma lakes combined covered 17 % of the total lake area but contributed disproportionally to the overall spatial uncertainty in lake area with a 95 % confidence interval between 0.15 and 0.38 × 106 km2. Rivers and streams were estimated to cover 0.12 × 106 km2 (0.5 % of domain), of which 8 % was associated with high-methane-emitting headwaters that drain organic-rich landscapes. Distinct combinations of spatially co-occurring wetland and lake classes were identified across the BAWLD domain, allowing for the mapping of “wetscapes” that have characteristic methane emission magnitudes and sensitivities to climate change at regional scales. With BAWLD, we provide a dataset which avoids double-accounting of wetland, lake, and river extents and which includes confidence intervals for each land cover class. As such, BAWLD will be suitable for many hydrological and biogeochemical modelling and upscaling efforts for the northern boreal and arctic region, in particular those aimed at improving assessments of current and future methane emissions.

One source of uncertainty is the timing and drivers of the spring transition. Remote sensing can provide important information on this transition, but persistent foliage greenness, seasonal snow cover, and a high prevalence of mixed forest stands (both deciduous and evergreen species) complicate interpretation of these signals. We collected tower-based remotely sensed data (reflectance-based vegetation indices and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence [SIF]), stem radius measurements, gross primary productivity, and environmental conditions in a boreal mixed forest stand. Evaluation of this data set shows a two-phased spring transition. The first phase is the reactivation of photosynthesis and transpiration in evergreens, marked by an increase in relative SIF, and is triggered by thawed stems, warm air temperatures, and increased available soil moisture. The second phase is a reduction in bulk photoprotective pigments in evergreens, marked by an increase in the Chlorophyll-Carotenoid Index. Deciduous leaf-out occurs during this phase, marked by an increase in all remotely sensed metrics. The second phase is controlled by soil thaw. Our results demonstrate that remote sensing metrics can be used to detect specific physiological changes in boreal tree species during the spring transition. The two-phased transition explains inconsistencies in remote sensing estimates of the timing and drivers of spring recovery. Our results imply that satellite-based observations will improve by using a combination of vegetation indices and SIF, along with species distribution information.</abstract><url hash="57bff036">G21-94001</url><doi>10.1029/2020jg006191</doi><bibkey>Pierrat-2021-Tower‐Based</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Explaining the Shortcomings of Log‐Transforming the Dependent Variable in Regression Models and Recommending a Better Alternative: Evidence From Soil CO

Altaf</first><last>Arain</last></author><abstract>Log-transforming the dependent variable of a regression model, though convenient and frequently used, is accompanied by an under-prediction problem. We found that this underprediction can reach up to 20%, which is significant in studies that aim to estimate annual budgets. The fundamental reason for this problem is simply that the log-function is concave, and it has nothing to do with whether the dependent variable has a log-normal distribution or not. Using field-observed data of soil CO2 emission, soil temperature and soil moisture in a saturated-specification of a regression model for predicting emissions, we revealed that the under-predictions of the log-transformed approach were pervasive and systematically biased. The key determinant of the problem's severity was the coefficient of variation in the dependent variable that differed among different combinations of the values of the explanatory factors. By applying a parsimonious (Gaussian-Gamma) specification of the regression model to data from four different ecosystems, we found that this under-prediction problem was serious to various extents, and that for a relatively weak explanatory factor, the log-transformed approach is prone to yield a physically nonsensical estimated coefficient. Finally, we showed and concluded that the problem can be avoided by switching to the nonlinear approach, which does not require the assumption of homoscedasticity for the error term in computing the standard errors of the estimated coefficients.</abstract><url hash="ceb6a18c">G21-94002</url><doi>10.1029/2021jg006238</doi><bibkey>Liaw-2021-Explaining</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="95"><meta><booktitle>Nutrition Journal, Volume 20, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Virtual barriers: unpacking the sustainability implications of online food spaces and the Yellowknife Farmers Market’s response to COVID-19</title><author><first>Josalyn</first><last>Radcliffe</last></author><author><first>Kelly</first><last>Skinner</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Spring</last></author><author><first>Lise</first><last>Picard</last></author><author><first>France</first><last>Benoit</last></author><author><first>Warren</first><last>Dodd</last></author><abstract>Abstract Background Through their support of local agriculture, relationships, and healthy diets, farmers markets can contribute to a sustainable food system. Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. We explore the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system through a case study of the YKFM. Methods In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The evaluation included an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, a vendor survey and interviews were deferred. Data collected from the two patron surveys, alongside researcher observations, available literature, public announcements, and informal email and phone discussions, inform the discussion. Results For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online; instead, they proposed and implemented a “Shop, don’t stop” market. Informal conversations suggested the small scale of the market and technology challenges were perceived barriers to moving online. The physically-distanced market was well-attended and featured in local media. Conclusions NWT food strategies rely on farmers markets to nurture a local food system. Data suggest a potential incongruence between an online model and important market characteristics such as the event-like atmosphere. Available literature suggests online markets can support local food by facilitating purchasing and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. The decision not to move online for the YKFM reflects market patron characteristics and current food context in Yellowknife and the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.</abstract><url hash="ef039753">G21-95001</url><doi>10.1186/s12937-021-00664-x</doi><bibkey>Radcliffe-2021-Virtual</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="96"><meta><booktitle>Public Health Nutrition, Volume 24, Issue 6</booktitle><publisher>Cambridge University Press (CUP)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Game bird consumption in Dene communities of the Northwest Territories, Canada</title><author><first>Mylène</first><last>Ratelle</last></author><author><first>Laurie</first><last>Haig</last></author><author><first>Brian D</first><last>Laird</last></author><author><first>Kelly</first><last>Skinner</last></author><abstract>Abstract Objective: Game bird consumption is an important part of the diet of Indigenous populations in Canada and, as part of country food consumption, is associated with improved nutritional status. The objective of this project was to document the consumption of game birds for Dene First Nations in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Design: Participants were invited to complete a FFQ using an iPad to document the types of country foods consumed, as well as consumption frequency and preparation methods, including thirteen types of game birds. Setting: The project was implemented in nine communities in the Dehcho and Sahtú regions of the NWT, Canada. Participants: A total of 237 children and adult participants from Dene First Nations in the Mackenzie Valley region of the NWT took part in the current study. Results: FFQ findings indicated that game birds were frequently consumed in both Dehcho and Sahtú communities. Canada goose and mallard were found to be consumed by the largest number of participants. Five different species (including Canada goose and mallard) were found to be consumed by at least 25 % of participants over the last year. When consuming game birds, most participants reported consuming the meat as well as most, if not all, other parts of the bird. Conclusions: Differences were observed since the last country food assessment in the 1990s in the same regions. These findings increase knowledge of the current Dene diet patterns and support the understanding of diet transition.</abstract><url hash="fdb638bd">G21-96001</url><pages>1229-1239</pages><doi>10.1017/s1368980021000021</doi><bibkey>Ratelle-2021-Game</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="97"><meta><booktitle>Ecology and Evolution, Volume 11, Issue 15</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Permafrost condition determines plant community composition and community‐level foliar functional traits in a boreal peatland</title><author><first>Katherine M.</first><last>Standen</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Boreal peatlands are critical ecosystems globally because they house 30%–40% of terrestrial carbon (C), much of which is stored in permafrost soil vulnerable to climate warming-induced thaw. Permafrost thaw leads to thickening of the active (seasonally thawed) layer and alters nutrient and light availability. These physical changes may influence community-level plant functional traits through intraspecific trait variation and/or species turnover. As permafrost thaw is expected to cause an efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the soil to the atmosphere, it is important to understand thaw-induced changes in plant community productivity to evaluate whether these changes may offset some of the anticipated increases in C emissions. To this end, we collected vascular plant community composition and foliar functional trait data along gradients in aboveground tree biomass and active layer thickness (ALT) in a rapidly thawing boreal peatland, with the expectation that changes in above- and belowground conditions are indicative of altered resource availability. We aimed to determine whether community-level traits vary across these gradients, and whether these changes are dominated by intraspecific trait variation, species turnover, or both. Our results highlight that variability in community-level traits was largely attributable to species turnover and that both community composition and traits were predominantly driven by ALT. Specifically, thicker active layers associated with permafrost-free peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens) shifted community composition from slower-growing evergreen shrubs to faster-growing graminoids and forbs with a corresponding shift toward more productive trait values. The results from this rapidly thawing peatland suggest that continued warming-induced permafrost thaw and thermokarst development alter plant community composition and community-level traits and thus ecosystem productivity. Increased productivity may help to mitigate anticipated CO2 efflux from thawing permafrost, at least in the short term, though this response may be swamped by increase CH4 release.</abstract><url hash="450a5fd8">G21-97001</url><pages>10133-10146</pages><doi>10.1002/ece3.7818</doi><bibkey>Standen-2021-Permafrost</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="98"><meta><booktitle>Global Change Biology, Volume 27, Issue 17</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Statistical upscaling of ecosystem CO

Statistical models are increasingly used to predict (i.e., upscale) CO2 fluxes across large spatial domains, but the reliability of different modeling techniques, each with different specifications and assumptions, has not been assessed in detail. Here, we compile eddy covariance and chamber measurements of annual and growing season CO2 fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during 1990–2015 from 148 terrestrial high-latitude (i.e., tundra and boreal) sites to analyze the spatial patterns and drivers of CO2 fluxes and test the accuracy and uncertainty of different statistical models. CO2 fluxes were upscaled at relatively high spatial resolution (1 km2) across the high-latitude region using five commonly used statistical models and their ensemble, that is, the median of all five models, using climatic, vegetation, and soil predictors. We found the performance of machine learning and ensemble predictions to outperform traditional regression methods. We also found the predictive performance of NEE-focused models to be low, relative to models predicting GPP and ER. Our data compilation and ensemble predictions showed that CO2 sink strength was larger in the boreal biome (observed and predicted average annual NEE −46 and −29 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively) compared to tundra (average annual NEE +10 and −2 g C m−2 yr−1). This pattern was associated with large spatial variability, reflecting local heterogeneity in soil organic carbon stocks, climate, and vegetation productivity. The terrestrial ecosystem CO2 budget, estimated using the annual NEE ensemble prediction, suggests the high-latitude region was on average an annual CO2 sink during 1990–2015, although uncertainty remains high.</abstract><url hash="1d694f8e">G21-98001</url><pages>4040-4059</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15659</doi><bibkey>Virkkala-2021-Statistical</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="99"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Research Letters, Volume 16, Issue 8</booktitle><publisher>IOP Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Soil respiration strongly offsets carbon uptake in Alaska and Northwest Canada</title><author><first>Jennifer D</first><last>Watts</last></author><author><first>Susan M</first><last>Natali</last></author><author><first>Christina</first><last>Minions</last></author><author><first>Dave</first><last>Risk</last></author><author><first>Kyle</first><last>Arndt</last></author><author><first>Donatella</first><last>Zona</last></author><author><first>Eugénie S</first><last>Euskirchen</last></author><author><first>Adrian V</first><last>Rocha</last></author><author><first>Oliver</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>Manuel</first><last>Helbig</last></author><author><first>Aram</first><last>Kalhori</last></author><author><first>Walt</first><last>Oechel</last></author><author><first>Hiroki</first><last>Ikawa</last></author><author><first>Masahito</first><last>Ueyama</last></author><author><first>Rikie</first><last>Suzuki</last></author><author><first>Hideki</first><last>Kobayashi</last></author><author><first>Gerardo</first><last>Celis</last></author><author><first>Edward A G</first><last>Schuur</last></author><author><first>Elyn</first><last>Humphreys</last></author><author><first>Yongwon</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>Bang-Yong</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>Scott</first><last>Goetz</last></author><author><first>Nima</first><last>Madani</last></author><author><first>Luke D</first><last>Schiferl</last></author><author><first>Roisin</first><last>Commane</last></author><author><first>John S</first><last>Kimball</last></author><author><first>Zhihua</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Margaret S</first><last>Torn</last></author><author><first>Stefano</first><last>Potter</last></author><author><first>Jonathan A</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>M Torre</first><last>Jorgenson</last></author><author><first>Jingfeng</first><last>Xiao</last></author><author><first>Xing</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Colin</first><last>Edgar</last></author><abstract>Abstract Soil respiration (i.e. from soils and roots) provides one of the largest global fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the atmosphere and is likely to increase with warming, yet the magnitude of soil respiration from rapidly thawing Arctic-boreal regions is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we first compiled a new CO 2 flux database for permafrost-affected tundra and boreal ecosystems in Alaska and Northwest Canada. We then used the CO 2 database, multi-sensor satellite imagery, and random forest models to assess the regional magnitude of soil respiration. The flux database includes a new Soil Respiration Station network of chamber-based fluxes, and fluxes from eddy covariance towers. Our site-level data, spanning September 2016 to August 2017, revealed that the largest soil respiration emissions occurred during the summer (June–August) and that summer fluxes were higher in boreal sites (1.87 ± 0.67 g CO 2 –C m −2 d −1 ) relative to tundra (0.94 ± 0.4 g CO 2 –C m −2 d −1 ). We also observed considerable emissions (boreal: 0.24 ± 0.2 g CO 2 –C m −2 d −1 ; tundra: 0.18 ± 0.16 g CO 2 –C m −2 d −1 ) from soils during the winter (November–March) despite frozen surface conditions. Our model estimates indicated an annual region-wide loss from soil respiration of 591 ± 120 Tg CO 2 –C during the 2016–2017 period. Summer months contributed to 58% of the regional soil respiration, winter months contributed to 15%, and the shoulder months contributed to 27%. In total, soil respiration offset 54% of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) across the study domain. We also found that in tundra environments, transitional tundra/boreal ecotones, and in landscapes recently affected by fire, soil respiration often exceeded GPP, resulting in a net annual source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. As this region continues to warm, soil respiration may increasingly offset GPP, further amplifying global climate change.</abstract><url hash="a5d528eb">G21-99001</url><pages>084051</pages><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac1222</doi><bibkey>Watts-2021-Soil</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="100"><meta><booktitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 118, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Widespread decline in winds delayed autumn foliar senescence over high latitudes</title><author><first>Chaoyang</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>Jian</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Philippe</first><last>Ciais</last></author><author><first>Josep</first><last>Peñuelas</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyang</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Oliver</first><last>Sonnentag</last></author><author><first>Feng</first><last>Tian</last></author><author><first>Xiaoyue</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Huanjiong</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Ronggao</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Yongshuo H.</first><last>Fu</last></author><author><first>Quansheng</first><last>Ge</last></author><abstract>The high northern latitudes (&gt;50°) experienced a pronounced surface stilling (i.e., decline in winds) with climate change. As a drying factor, the influences of changes in winds on the date of autumn foliar senescence (DFS) remain largely unknown and are potentially important as a mechanism explaining the interannual variability of autumn phenology. Using 183,448 phenological observations at 2,405 sites, long-term site-scale water vapor and carbon dioxide flux measurements, and 34 y of satellite greenness data, here we show that the decline in winds is significantly associated with extended DFS and could have a relative importance comparable with temperature and precipitation effects in contributing to the DFS trends. We further demonstrate that decline in winds reduces evapotranspiration, which results in less soil water losses and consequently more favorable growth conditions in late autumn. In addition, declining winds also lead to less leaf abscission damage which could delay leaf senescence and to a decreased cooling effect and therefore less frost damage. Our results are potentially useful for carbon flux modeling because an improved algorithm based on these findings projected overall widespread earlier DFS than currently expected by the end of this century, contributing potentially to a positive feedback to climate.</abstract><url hash="4cf9d032">G21-100001</url><doi>10.1073/pnas.2015821118</doi><bibkey>Wu-2021-Widespread</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="101"><meta><booktitle>Sustainability, Volume 13, Issue 15</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Special Issue “Levering Sustainable Food Systems to Address Climate Change (Pandemics and Other Shocks and Hazards): Possible Transformations”</title><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Spring</last></author><author><first>Erin</first><last>Nelson</last></author><author><first>Irena</first><last>Knezevic</last></author><author><first>Patricia</first><last>Ballamingie</last></author><author><first>Alison</first><last>Blay-Palmer</last></author><abstract>Since we first conceived of this Special Issue, “Levering Sustainable Food Systems to Address Climate Change—Possible Transformations”, COVID-19 has turned the world upside down [...]</abstract><url hash="f445b757">G21-101001</url><pages>8206</pages><doi>10.3390/su13158206</doi><bibkey>Spring-2021-Special</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="102"><meta><booktitle>Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 574</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Determining the role of diffusion and basement flux in controlling 4He distribution in sedimentary basin fluids</title><author><first>Anran</first><last>Cheng</last></author><author><first>Barbara</first><last>Sherwood Lollar</last></author><author><first>Oliver</first><last>Warr</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><author><first>Erdem</first><last>Idiz</last></author><author><first>Scott O.C.</first><last>Mundle</last></author><author><first>Peter H.</first><last>Barry</last></author><author><first>David J.</first><last>Byrne</last></author><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>Mabry</last></author><author><first>Chris J.</first><last>Ballentine</last></author><abstract>The transport of helium from the crystalline continental basement and overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary formations to the near surface can be controlled by both diffusive and advective processes. The relative role of each is vital to helium resource prediction, and important in quantifying the residence times of fluids relevant to groundwater resources, hydrocarbon systems, geologic repositories for nuclear waste and carbon sequestration. The Williston Basin, North America, is a prominent sedimentary basin, providing an excellent natural laboratory to assess these processes. Here, we report noble gas isotopic and composition data for 28 gas samples from natural gas wells that sample different stratigraphic horizons down to the basement (Cretaceous to the Cambrian). Helium isotope ratios show a resolvable mantle 3 He component (up to 4.7%) in most samples. Neon isotopic compositions of the Cambrian samples are consistent with a crystalline basement gas contribution. Both helium and neon isotopic observations provide evidence for the contribution of conservative noble gases from the crystalline basement or deeper into the overlying sedimentary basin. 4 He groundwater concentrations in the sedimentary formations, calculated from 4 He/ 20 Ne values in gas samples, are in excess of in situ U+Th 4 He production in some shallow units and depleted in others, providing further evidence of cross formation gas contributions. The highest 4 He groundwater concentrations can be compared with the results obtained from a fully-coupled vertical scale transport model characterising diffusive-dominated transport through a static groundwater column. The model includes the 4 He flux into the basin from the Precambrian basement and quantifies the apparent basement 4 He flux to be between 0.8 - 1.6 × 10 − 6 mol 4 He/m 2 yr, comparable to the steady-state flux estimated for the average continental crust (1.47 × 10 − 6 mol 4 He/m 2 yr) ( Torgersen, 2010 ). The lithologies in which 4 He concentrations are significantly lower than the reference model predictions are consistent with a history of water flooding and produced water disposal in those formations over decades of hydrocarbon production. While an advective component cannot be ruled out, this work demonstrates the importance of both diffusion and the basin architecture development in controlling 4 He flux into and out of different lithologies. The assumption of negligible 4 He loss from the top surface of a lithology is often made when determining the 4 He age of its groundwater. In the Williston Basin, this study shows that deeper lithologies may reach steady state at different stages of basin development, with shallower lithologies sometimes also showing significant 4 He loss from their top surface. In the Williston Basin, 4 He diffusive loss from the target lithology must be considered to accurately interpret 4 He groundwater residence times and accumulation potential. • Noble gases were measured in gas wells from sedimentary units of the Williston Basin. • A He and Ne flux from the crystalline basement is consistent with their isotopes. • Numerical model consistent with diffusive transport of He through sedimentary units. • Numerical model shows multiple periods of steady state He flux. • Steady state He flux critical in He dating applications and He exploration.</abstract><url hash="e6f018b9">G21-102001</url><pages>117175</pages><doi>10.1016/j.epsl.2021.117175</doi><bibkey>Cheng-2021-Determining</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="103"><meta><booktitle>Science, Volume 372, Issue 6540</booktitle><publisher>American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The hidden crisis beneath our feet</title><author><first>James S.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>Disappearing groundwater requires action to prevent widespread water scarcity</abstract><url hash="5e4c7fdc">G21-103001</url><pages>344-345</pages><doi>10.1126/science.abh2867</doi><bibkey>Famiglietti-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="104"><meta><booktitle>Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 48, Issue 16</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Crustal Groundwater Volumes Greater Than Previously Thought</title><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>Oliver</first><last>Warr</last></author><author><first>Barbara</first><last>Sherwood Lollar</last></author><author><first>Christopher J.</first><last>Ballentine</last></author><author><first>James S.</first><last>Famiglietti</last></author><author><first>Ji‐Hyun</first><last>Kim</last></author><author><first>Joseph R.</first><last>Michalski</last></author><author><first>John F.</first><last>Mustard</last></author><author><first>Jesse</first><last>Tarnas</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><abstract>Global groundwater volumes in the upper 2 km of the Earth's continental crust—critical for water security—are well estimated. Beyond these depths, a vast body of largely saline and non-potable groundwater exists down to at least 10 km—a volume that has not yet been quantified reliably at the global scale. Here, we estimate the amount of groundwater present in the upper 10 km of the Earth's continental crust by examining the distribution of sedimentary and crystalline rocks with depth and applying porosity-depth relationships. We demonstrate that groundwater in the 2–10 km zone (what we call “deep groundwater”) has a volume comparable to that of groundwater in the upper 2 km of the Earth's crust. These new estimates make groundwater the largest continental reservoir of water, ahead of ice sheets, provide a basis to quantify geochemical cycles, and constrain the potential for large-scale isolation of waste fluids.</abstract><url hash="c39b4765">G21-104001</url><doi>10.1029/2021gl093549</doi><bibkey>Ferguson-2021-Crustal</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="105"><meta><booktitle>Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 48, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Deep Meteoric Water Circulation in Earth's Crust</title><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>Deep meteoric waters comprise a key component of the hydrologic cycle, transferring water, energy, and life between the earth’s surface and deeper crustal environments, yet little is known about th...</abstract><url hash="7b272000">G21-105001</url><doi>10.1029/2020gl090461</doi><bibkey>McIntosh-2021-Deep</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="106"><meta><booktitle>Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 48, Issue 20</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Variability in Timing and Transport of Pleistocene Meltwater Recharge to Regional Aquifers</title><author><first>Aidan C.</first><last>Mowat</last></author><author><first>Daniel J.</first><last>Francis</last></author><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>Matthew B.

We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of recharge events from glaciations over the last 2 million years in the Williston Basin, Canada. Integration of fluid chemistry, stable isotope data, and transport modeling indicate that meltwater arrived at depths of ∼600–1000 m in the northcentral region of the Williston Basin at two separate time periods, 75–150 and 300 ka, which we attribute to permeability differences between stacked aquifer systems. Our findings indicate that meltwater recharge extended along the northern margin of the Williston Basin as well as previously identified recharge areas to the east. Given the distance of measurements from recharge areas, evidence of recharge from the early to mid-Pleistocene appears to be preserved in the Williston Basin.</abstract><url hash="69928fee">G21-106001</url><doi>10.1029/2021gl094285</doi><bibkey>Mowat-2021-Variability</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="107"><meta><booktitle>Groundwater, Volume 60, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Commingled Fluids in Abandoned Boreholes: Proximity Analysis of a Hidden Liability</title><author><first>Christopher</first><last>Perra</last></author><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>Theresa</first><last>Watson</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>The interactions between old abandoned wellbores of suspect well integrity with hydraulic fracturing (HF), enhanced oil recovery (EOR), or salt water disposal (SWD) operations can result in upward leakage of deep aqueous liquids into overlying aquifers. This potential for upward fluid migration is largely unquantified as monitoring abandoned wells is rarely done, and leakage may go unnoticed especially when in deeper aquifers. This study performs a proximity analysis between old abandoned wells and HF, EOR, and SWD wells, and identifies commingled old abandoned wellbores, which are those wells where groundwater may flow from one aquifer to one or more other aquifers, to identify the locations with the greatest potential for upward aqueous fluid migration at three study sites in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Our analysis indicates that at all three study sites there are several locations where HF, EOR, or SWD operations are located in close proximity to a given old abandoned well. Much of this overlap occurs in formations above typically produced hydrocarbon reservoirs but below exploited potable aquifers, otherwise known as the intermediate zone, which is often connected between abandonment plugs in old abandoned wells. Information on the intermediate zone is often lacking, and this study suggests that unanticipated alterations to groundwater flow systems within the intermediate zone may be occurring. Results indicate the need for more field-based research on the intermediate zone.</abstract><url hash="d12ee88b">G21-107001</url><pages>210-224</pages><doi>10.1111/gwat.13140</doi><bibkey>Perra-2021-Commingled</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="108"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, Volume 37</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Spatial variability of precipitation extremes over Italy using a fine-resolution gridded product</title><author><first>Benedetta</first><last>Moccia</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>Fabio</first><last>Russo</last></author><author><first>Francesco</first><last>Napolitano</last></author><abstract>• Analysis shows the G E V distribution can underestimate precipitation extremes. • G E V + and B r X I I describe more consistently extreme precipitation than the G E V . • Maps of rainfall depths for different return periods are provided for Italy.

Here we investigate the performance of the Generalized Extreme Value ( G E V ) distribution, using a fine-resolution satellite-based gridded product, to analyze 13,247 daily rainfall annual maxima samples. A non-extreme value distribution with a power-type behavior, that is, the Burr Type XII ( B r X I I ), is also evaluated and used to test the reliability of the G E V in describing extreme rainfall. (1) in 44.9 % of the analyzed samples the G E V predicts an upper rainfall limit; we deem this is an artifact due to sample variations; (2) we suggest the G E V + distribution, that is, the G E V with shape parameters restricted only to positive values as a more consistent model complying with the nature of extreme precipitation; (3) G E V , G E V + , and B r X I I performed equally well in describing the observed annual precipitation, yet all distributions underestimate the observed sample maximum; (4) the B r X I I , for large return periods, predicts larger rainfall amounts compared to G E V indicating that G E V estimates could underestimate the risk of extremes; and (5) the correlation between the predicted rainfall and the elevation is investigated.

Here, we advance random fields simulation by introducing the concepts of general velocity fields and general anisotropy transformations. This expands the capabilities of the so-called Complete Stochastic Modeling Solution (CoSMoS) framework enabling the simulation of random fields (RF's) preserving: (a) any non-Gaussian marginal distribution, (b) any spatiotemporal correlation structure (STCS), (c) general advection expressed by velocity fields with locally varying speed and direction, and (d) locally varying anisotropy. We also introduce new copula-based STCS's and provide conditions guaranteeing their positive definiteness. To illustrate the potential of CoSMoS, we simulate RF's with complex patterns and motion mimicking rainfall storms moving across an area, spiraling fields resembling weather cyclones, fields converging to (or diverging from) a point, and colliding air masses.

The soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC) characterizes the relationship between liquid water content and temperature in frozen soils. Most hydrological models represent the SFC using only capillary and adsorption effects with a relationship known as the Generalized Clapeyron Equation (GCE). In this study, we develop and test a salt exclusion model for characterizing the SFC, comparing this with the GCE-based model and a combined salt-GCE effect model. We test these models against measured SFCs in laboratory and field experiments with diverse soil textures and salinities. We consistently found that the GCE-based models under-predicted freezing-point depression. We were able to match the observations with the salt exclusion model and the combined model, suggesting that salinity is a dominant control on the SFC in real soils that always contain solutes. In modeling applications where the salinity is unknown, the soil bulk solute concentration can be treated as a single fitting parameter. Improved characterization of the SFC may result in improvements in coupled mass-heat transport models for simulating hydrological processes in cold regions, particularly the hydraulic properties of frozen soils and the hydraulic head in frozen soils that drives cryosuction.</abstract><url hash="a8f8ce02">G21-109002</url><doi>10.1029/2021wr030070</doi><bibkey>Amankwah-2021-A</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="110"><meta><booktitle>Surveys in Geophysics, Volume 42, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Global Water Cycle Budget: A Chronological Review</title><author><first>Mijael Rodrigo</first><last>Vargas Godoy</last></author><author><first>Yannis</first><last>Markonis</last></author><author><first>Martin</first><last>Hanel</last></author><author><first>Jan</first><last>Kyselý</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><abstract /><url hash="7199f982">G21-110001</url><pages>1075-1107</pages><doi>10.1007/s10712-021-09652-6</doi><bibkey>Vargas Godoy-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="111"><meta><booktitle>Advances in Water Resources, Volume 156</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Informing Stochastic Streamflow Generation by Large-Scale Climate Indices at Single and Multiple Sites</title><author><first>Masoud</first><last>Zaerpour</last></author><author><first>Simon Michael</first><last>Papalexiou</last></author><author><first>Ali</first><last>Nazemi</last></author><abstract>• An algorithm for incorporating climate indices in streamflow generation is proposed • The algorithm is based on vine copulas, merged with a formal input selector • The algorithm enables representing dynamic impacts of climate indices on streamflow • The algorithm shows a better prediction skill, particularly in high flow seasons • The algorithm captures modes of streamflow variability better than existing schemes • The algorithm is generic and can be applied in single and multisite modes Despite the existence of several stochastic streamflow generators, not much attention has been given to representing the impacts of large-scale climate indices on seasonal to interannual streamflow variability.

The results demonstrate higher skills than existing models both in terms of representing intra- and inter-annual variability, as well as accuracy and predictability of streamflow, particularly during high flow seasons.

Smart packaging systems also help to prolong the shelf life of perishable foods during transport and mass storage, which are difficult to regulate otherwise. The use of these ever-progressing technologies in the packaging of fruits has the potential to result in many positive consequences, including improved fruit quality, reduced waste, and associated improved public health. In this review, we examine the role of smart packaging in fruit packaging, current-state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects. First, we discuss the motivation behind fruit quality monitoring and maintenance, followed by the background on the development process of fruits, factors used in determining fruit quality, and the classification of smart packaging technologies. Then, we discuss conventional freshness sensors for packaged fruits including direct and indirect freshness indicators. After that, we provide examples of possible smart packaging systems and sensors that can be used in monitoring fruits quality, followed by several strategies to mitigate premature fruit decay, and active packaging technologies. Finally, we discuss the prospects of smart packaging application for fruit quality monitoring along with the associated challenges and prospects.</abstract><url hash="632c566c">G21-113001</url><pages>1509</pages><doi>10.3390/s21041509</doi><bibkey>Alam-2021-Fruit</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="114"><meta><booktitle>Micromachines, Volume 12, Issue 9</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Integrated Microfluidic-Based Platforms for On-Site Detection and Quantification of Infectious Pathogens: Towards On-Site Medical Translation of SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Platforms</title><author><first>Andres</first><last>Escobar</last></author><author><first>Phyllis</first><last>Chiu</last></author><author><first>Jianxi</first><last>Qu</last></author><author><first>Yushan</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Chang-qing</first><last>Xu</last></author><abstract>The rapid detection and quantification of infectious pathogens is an essential component to the control of potentially lethal outbreaks among human populations worldwide. Several of these highly infectious pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been cemented in human history as causing epidemics or pandemics due to their lethality and contagiousness. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of these highly infectious pathogens that have recently become one of the leading causes of globally reported deaths, creating one of the worst economic downturns and health crises in the last century. As a result, the necessity for highly accurate and increasingly rapid on-site diagnostic platforms for highly infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically over the last two years. Current conventional non-microfluidic diagnostic techniques have limitations in their effectiveness as on-site devices due to their large turnaround times, operational costs and the need for laboratory equipment. In this review, we first present criteria, both novel and previously determined, as a foundation for the development of effective and viable on-site microfluidic diagnostic platforms for several notable pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. This list of criteria includes standards that were set out by the WHO, as well as our own “seven pillars” for effective microfluidic integration. We then evaluate the use of microfluidic integration to improve upon currently, and previously, existing platforms for the detection of infectious pathogens. Finally, we discuss a stage-wise means to translate our findings into a fundamental framework towards the development of more effective on-site SARS-CoV-2 microfluidic-integrated platforms that may facilitate future pandemic diagnostic and research endeavors. Through microfluidic integration, many limitations in currently existing infectious pathogen diagnostic platforms can be eliminated or improved upon.</abstract><url hash="fefb6ed5">G21-114001</url><pages>1079</pages><doi>10.3390/mi12091079</doi><bibkey>Escobar-2021-Integrated</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="115"><meta><booktitle>Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Volume 32</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Critical review of bio/nano sensors for arsenic detection</title><author><first>Chenghua</first><last>Zong</last></author><author><first>Xiaoting</first><last>Jin</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>Detection of arsenic is a long-standing challenge in environmental analytical chemistry. In recent years, using biomolecules and nanomaterials for sensing arsenic has been growingly reported. In this article, this field is critically reviewed based on some recent fundamental understandings including interactions between arsenic and gold, thiol, and DNA aptamers. First, taking advantage of the adsorption of As(III) on noble metal surfaces such as silver and gold, sensors were developed based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, electrochemistry and colorimetry. In addition, by functionalizing metal nanoparticles with thiol containing molecules, As(III) induced aggregation of the particles based on As(III)/thiol interactions. As(V) interacts with metal oxides strongly and competitive sensors were developed by displacing pre-adsorbed DNA oligonucleotides. A DNA aptamer was selected for As(III) and many sensors were reported based on this aptamer, although careful binding measurements indicated that the sequence has no affinity towards As(III). Overall, bio/nano systems are promising for the detection of arsenic. Future work on fundamental studies, searching for more specific arsenic binding materials and aptamers, incorporation of sensors into portable devices, and more systematic test of sensors in real samples could be interesting and useful research topics.</abstract><url hash="464709b0">G21-115001</url><pages>e00143</pages><doi>10.1016/j.teac.2021.e00143</doi><bibkey>Zong-2021-Critical</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="116"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Membrane Science, Volume 627</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Investigating the stability of electrically conductive membranes</title><author><first>Mohamad Amin</first><last>Halali</last></author><author><first>Melissa</first><last>Larocque</last></author><author><first>Charles-Franҫois</first><last>de Lannoy</last></author><abstract>Stability of electrically conductive membranes (ECM) is critical for expanding their application in separation-based technologies. In this work, ECMs were synthesized by coating polyethersulfone membranes with carbon nanotubes (CNT) crosslinked to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using two types of crosslinkers (succinic acid or glutaraldehyde). ECMs demonstrated a 21% reduction in flux over 4 h under cathodic potential (2 V) in comparison to a 69% reduction in flux for control experiments when filtering a realistic bacterial suspension. Subsequently, the electrochemical, physical, and mechanical stability of the ECMs were explored using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry, an evaluation of polymer leaching from membranes, and micro mechanical scratch testing, respectively. ECMs were shown to be unstable under anodic potentials (2–4 V) with the glutaraldehyde crosslinking demonstrating the highest electrochemical stability. PVA was shown to be a physically unstable crosslinking agent for CNTs under concentration polarization conditions. Instability was moderated by extending CP layers through thicker and less dense nanolayers. ECMs showed higher mechanical stability and resistance to surface damage, in particular when coated with glutaraldehyde. We quantified the relationship between ECM surface instability and their physical and electrochemical properties. In so doing, we provide guidance for making practical and scalable electrically conductive membranes. • Applied potential impedes the development of membrane biofouling. • Electrically conductive membranes are unstable under operating conditions. • Physical, mechanical, and electrochemical stability of membranes were investigated. • PVA and GA protect CNT from anodic electro-oxidation.</abstract><url hash="54f2a65e">G21-116001</url><pages>119181</pages><doi>10.1016/j.memsci.2021.119181</doi><bibkey>Halali-2021-Investigating</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="117"><meta><booktitle>PLOS ONE, Volume 16, Issue 3</booktitle><publisher>Public Library of Science (PLoS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Pencil graphite as electrode platform for free chlorine sensors and energy storage devices</title><author><first>Jahidul</first><last>Islam</last></author><author><first>Han</first><last>Shao</last></author><author><first>Md.

This paper reports the use of pencil graphite as an electrode for dual applications that include the detection of free residual chlorine using electro-oxidation process and as an electrochemical energy storage cathode. The pencil graphite is transferred to cellulose paper by drawing ten times and applied for the detection of free residual chlorine, which shows a sensitivity of 27 μA mM-1 cm-2 with a limit of detection of 88.9 μM and linearity up to 7 mM. The sample matrix effect study for the commonly interfering ions such as NO3-, SO42-, CO32-, Cl-, HCO3- shows minimal impact on free residual chlorine detection. Pencil graphite then used after cyclic voltammogram treatment as a cathode in the aqueous Zn/Al-ion battery, showing an average discharge potential plateau of ~1.1 V, with a specific cathode capacity of ~54.1 mAh g-1 at a current of 55 mA g-1. It maintains ~95.8% of its initial efficiency after 100 cycles. Results obtained from the density functional theory calculation is consistent with the electro-oxidation process involved in the detection of free residual chlorine, as well as intercalation and de-intercalation behavior of Al3+ into the graphite layers of Zn/Al-ion battery. Therefore, pencil graphite due to its excellent electro-oxidation and conducting properties, can be successfully implemented as low cost, disposable and green material for both sensor and energy-storage applications.</abstract><url hash="ec4ec13b">G21-117001</url><pages>e0248142</pages><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0248142</doi><bibkey>Islam-2021-Pencil</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="118"><meta><booktitle>Micromachines, Volume 12, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>A Microflow Cytometry-Based Agglutination Immunoassay for Point-of-Care Quantitative Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG</title><author><first>Jianxi</first><last>Qu</last></author><author><first>Mathieu</first><last>Chenier</last></author><author><first>Yushan</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Chang-qing</first><last>Xu</last></author><abstract>A rapid, sensitive and simple microflow cytometry-based agglutination immunoassay (MCIA) was developed for point-of-care (POC) quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies.

The 10 µL sample consumption, 30 min assay time and the compact setup make this technique suitable for POC quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</abstract><url hash="b42dd16d">G21-118001</url><pages>433</pages><doi>10.3390/mi12040433</doi><bibkey>Qu-2021-A</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="119"><meta><booktitle>Chemical Communications, Volume 57, Issue 62</booktitle><publisher>Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Selection of a self-cleaving ribozyme activated in a chemically and thermally denaturing environment</title><author><first>Lingzi</first><last>Ma</last></author><author><first>Zhicheng</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>A self-cleaving ribozyme was obtained from &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; selection, displaying site-specific cleavage activity under various denaturing conditions, such as high temperatures, 20 M formamide, and low salt concentrations.</abstract><url hash="0c91b608">G21-119001</url><pages>7641-7644</pages><doi>10.1039/d1cc03102c</doi><bibkey>Ma-2021-Selection</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="120"><meta><booktitle>Talanta, Volume 226</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Revised application of copper ion selective electrode (Cu-ISE) in marine waters: A new meta-calibration approach</title><author><first>Saša</first><last>Marcinek</last></author><author><first>Arnaud</first><last>Chapoulie</last></author><author><first>Pascal</first><last>Salaün</last></author><author><first>Scott</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Dario</first><last>Omanović</last></author><abstract>Abstract Copper (Cu) is a bio-essential trace element that is of concerns due to its potential toxicity at concentrations commonly encountered in coastal waters. Here, we revisit the applicability of Cu(II) ion selective electrode (Cu-ISE) based on a jalpaite membrane for the measurement of Cufree in seawater. At high total Cu concentration (&gt;0.1 mM), (near)Nernstian slope was obtained and determination of Cufree down to fM levels was possible. However, this slope decreases with decreasing total Cu concentration (e.g. 7 mV/decade at 15 nM total Cu) making the use of a common single calibration approach unreliable. To solve this problem, we carried out several calibrations at different levels of total Cu (15 nM - 1 mM) and ethylenediamine (EN: 5 μM - 15 mM) and fitted the calibration parameters (slope and intercept) as a function of total Cu using the Gompertz function (a meta-calibration approach). The derived empirical equations allowed the determination of Cufree at any total Cu concentration above 20 nM (determination of Cufree at lower total Cu levels is prevented by the dissolution of the electrode). We successfully tested this meta-calibration approach in UV digested seawater in presence of a synthetic ligand (EN), isolated natural organic matter (humic acid, HA) and in a natural estuarine sample. In each case, our meta-calibration approach provided a good agreement with modeled speciation data (Visual MINTEQ), while standard single approach failed. We provide here a new method for the direct determination of the free Cu ion concentration in seawater at levels relevant for coastal waters.</abstract><url hash="36398352">G21-120001</url><pages>122170</pages><doi>10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122170</doi><bibkey>Marcinek-2021-Revised</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="121"><meta><booktitle>Coordination Chemistry Reviews, Volume 428</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Phosphorothioate nucleic acids for probing metal binding, biosensing and nanotechnology</title><author><first>Runjhun</first><last>Saran</last></author><author><first>Zhicheng</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>• Fundamentals of phosphorothioate nucleic acids reviewed from synthesis to metal binding. • Applications of phosphorothioate nucleic acids in developing biosensors and chemical biology reviewed. • Applications of phosphorothioate DNA in assembly and the directed growth of nanomaterials reviewed. Phosphorothioate (PS) modification replaces one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms by sulfur in the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. While PS DNAs have been traditionally used as nuclease-resistant antisense agents and PS RNA as probe of metal binding in ribozymes, multiple new applications have emerged in recent years. In this review, we start by briefly introducing the structure and synthesis of PS nucleic acids followed by their fundamental chemical and biochemical properties. Further, their recently emerged surface science applications are discussed, such as attachment of DNA to various surfaces and nanomaterials containing thiophilic metals such as gold, silver and cadmium, and templating the growth of these materials. Their role in conferring structural effects in the presence of certain metal ions and in fishing out novel aptamers are also discussed. Covalent chemistry can be performed on the sulfur atom for further grafting functional groups to the backbone of DNA. For PS RNA, we discuss their role as probes for metal binding in ribozymes and DNAzymes, which leads to applications in detection of thiophilic metal ions. Since each PS modification site produces a chiral phosphorus center, the synthesis and purification of diastereomers and their applications are emphasized throughout this review. In the end, a few future research directions are discussed.</abstract><url hash="8e85e437">G21-121001</url><pages>213624</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ccr.2020.213624</doi><bibkey>Saran-2021-Phosphorothioate</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="122"><meta><booktitle>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, Volume 349</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Enhancing the sensitivity of cobalt based solid-state phosphate sensor using electrical pretreatment</title><author><first>Vinay</first><last>Patel</last></author><author><first>P.

Cobalt based sensors are attractive for this application as they are solid-state, have a quick response time, are easy to fabricate and can perform reagent-less measurements. However, these sensors have lower sensitivity, limited dynamic range and require a chemical conditioning in a standard solution before measurement. In this study, an in situ anodic current pretreatment method in sample solution itself is used to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor and alleviate the need of chemical conditioning before measurement. With electrical pretreatment, the sensor exhibited a linear range from 10 −6 M to 10 −3 M with a sensitivity of −91.4 mV/decade of change in dihydrogen phosphate concentration. No significant interference was detected with common interfering anions that are typically present in field water samples such as nitrate, sulfate and chloride. Finally, the sensor was also responsive when tested real water samples such as tap water, lake water and creek water spiked with phosphate. • A new in situ electrical pretreatment method is used to enhance the sensitivity of cobalt based phosphate sensors. • The in situ electrical pretreatment method eliminates the need of the tedious chemical pretreatment in standard solution. • The rapid pretreatment protocol can even extend the range of measurements to much lower concentrations (10-8 M). • Use of electrical pretreatment makes this a practical format for field use as standard solutions are not needed.</abstract><url hash="9c304bd9">G21-122001</url><pages>130789</pages><doi>10.1016/j.snb.2021.130789</doi><bibkey>Patel-2021-Enhancing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="123"><meta><booktitle>Biochemistry, Volume 60, Issue 24</booktitle><publisher>American Chemical Society (ACS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Probing Metal-Dependent Phosphate Binding for the Catalysis of the 17E DNAzyme</title><author><first>Woohyun J.</first><last>Moon</last></author><author><first>Po-Jung Jimmy</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>Juewen</first><last>Liu</last></author><abstract>The RNA-cleaving 17E DNAzyme exhibits different levels of cleavage activity in the presence of various divalent metal ions, with Pb2+ giving the fastest cleavage. In this study, the metal-phosphate interaction is probed to understand the trend of activity with different metal ions. For the first-row transition metals, the lowest activity shown by Ni2+ correlates with the inhibition by the inorganic phosphate and its water ligand exchange rate, suggesting inner-sphere metal coordination. Cleavage activity with the two stereoisomers of the phosphorothioate-modified substrates, Rp and Sp, indicated that Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ had the highest Sp:Rp activity ratio of &gt;900. Comparatively, the activity was much less affected using the thiophilic metals, including Pb2+, suggesting inner-sphere coordination. The pH-rate profiles showed that Pb2+ was different than the rest of the metal ions in having a smaller slope and a similar fitted apparent pKa and the pKa of metal-bound water. Combining previous reports and our current results, we propose that Pb2+ most likely plays the role of a general acid while the other metal ions are Lewis acid catalysts interacting with the scissile phosphate.</abstract><url hash="248c2cbc">G21-123001</url><pages>1909-1918</pages><doi>10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00091</doi><bibkey>Moon-2021-Probing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="124"><meta><booktitle>Remote Sensing, Volume 13, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Sensitivity of C-Band SAR Polarimetric Variables to the Directionality of Surface Roughness Parameters</title><author><first>Zohreh</first><last>Alijani</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>Lindsay</last></author><author><first>Melanie</first><last>Chabot</last></author><author><first>Tracy</first><last>Rowlandson</last></author><author><first>Aaron</first><last>Berg</last></author><abstract>Surface roughness is an important factor in many soil moisture retrieval models. Therefore, any mischaracterization of surface roughness parameters (root mean square height, RMSH, and correlation length, ʅ) may result in unreliable predictions and soil moisture estimations. In many environments, but particularly in agricultural settings, surface roughness parameters may show different behaviours with respect to the orientation or azimuth. Consequently, the relationship between SAR polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters may vary depending on measurement orientation. Generally, roughness obtained for many SAR-based studies is estimated using pin profilers that may, or may not, be collected with careful attention to orientation to the satellite look angle. In this study, we characterized surface roughness parameters in multi-azimuth mode using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). We characterized the surface roughness parameters in different orientations and then examined the sensitivity between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters; further, we compared these results to roughness profiles obtained using traditional pin profilers. The results showed that the polarimetric variables were more sensitive to the surface roughness parameters at higher incidence angles (θ). Moreover, when surface roughness measurements were conducted at the look angle of RADARSAT-2, more significant correlations were observed between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters. Our results also indicated that TLS can represent more reliable results than pin profiler in the measurement of the surface roughness parameters.</abstract><url hash="b95b1405">G21-124001</url><pages>2210</pages><doi>10.3390/rs13112210</doi><bibkey>Alijani-2021-Sensitivity</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="125"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Digital Earth, Volume 14, Issue 10</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The influence of tree transmissivity variations in winter on satellite snow parameter observations</title><author><first>Qinghuan</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Richard</first><last>Kelly</last></author><author><first>Juha</first><last>Lemmetyinen</last></author><author><first>Roger D.</first><last>De Roo</last></author><author><first>Jinmei</first><last>Pan</last></author><author><first>Yubao</first><last>Qiu</last></author><abstract>The ability to correct for the influence of forest cover is crucial for retrieval of surface geophysical parameters such as snow cover and soil properties from microwave remote sensing.

A property of these phenomena is the relationship between unfrozen water content and sub-freezing temperature, known as the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC). It is documented that this relationship exhibits hysteretic behaviour when frozen soil thaws, leading to the definition of the soil thawing characteristic curve (STC). Although explanations have been given for SFC/STC hysteresis, the effect that “scale”—particularly “measurement scale”—may have on these curves has received little attention. The most commonly used measurement scale metric is the “grain” or “support,” which is the spatial (or temporal) unit within which the measured variable is integrated—in this case, the soil volume sampled. We show (1) measurement support can influence the range and shape of the SFC and (2) hysteresis can be, at least partially, attributed to the support and location of the measurements comprising the SFC/STC. We simulated lab measured temperature, volumetric water content (VWC), and permittivity from soil samples undergoing freeze-thaw transitions using Hydrus-1D and a modified Dobson permittivity model. To assess the effect of measurement support and location on SFC/STC, we masked the simulated temperature and VWC/permittivity extent to match the instrument’s grain and location. By creating a detailed simulation of the intra- and inter-grain variability associated with the penetration of a freezing front, we demonstrate how measurement support and location can influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured. We show it is possible to simulate hysteresis in homogenous media with purely geometric considerations, suggesting that SFC/STC hysteresis may be more of an apparent phenomenon than mechanistically real. Lastly, we develop an understanding of how the location and support of soil temperature and VWC/permittivity measurements influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured.</abstract><url hash="1352dc8e">G21-126001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14269</doi><bibkey>Pardo Lara-2021-Implications</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="127"><meta><booktitle>Remote Sensing Letters, Volume 12, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Estimating wind slab thickness in a Tundra snowpack using Ku-band scatterometer observations</title><author><first>Aaron</first><last>Thompson</last></author><author><first>Richard</first><last>Kelly</last></author><abstract>Estimating snow water equivalent (SWE) in the northern high latitudesis important from climate, ecological and human perspectives since it enables us to track changes in spatiotemporal distribution...</abstract><url hash="abeebbeb">G21-127001</url><pages>1123-1135</pages><doi>10.1080/2150704x.2021.1961174</doi><bibkey>Thompson-2021-Estimating</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="128"><meta><booktitle>Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, Volume 47, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Considerations for Ku-Band Radar Retrieval of Snow Water Equivalent at Mid-Latitude Ontario Agricultural Sites</title><author><first>Aaron</first><last>Thompson</last></author><author><first>Richard</first><last>Kelly</last></author><abstract>Mid-latitude snow is understudied compared to snow in the northern high latitudes despite its importance as a source of freshwater to this economically significant region.

The vulnerability of public supply wells to water quality degradation may temporarily increase during these types of events. The Walkerton, ON, Canada, tragedy (2000) highlighted the threat to human health associated with the rapid transport of microbial pathogens to public supply wells during dynamic recharge events. Field research at the Thornton (Woodstock, ON, Canada) and Mannheim West (Kitchener, ON, Canada) well fields, situated in glacial overburden aquifers, identified a potential increase in vulnerability due to event-based recharge phenomena. Ephemeral surface water flow and local ponding containing microbial pathogen indicator species were observed and monitored within the capture zones of public supply wells following heavy rain and/or snowmelt. Elevated recharge rates beneath these temporary surface water features were estimated to range between 40 and 710 mm over two-week periods using analytical and numerical modelling based on the water level, soil moisture, and temperature data. Modelling also suggested that such events could reduce contaminant travel times to a supply well, increasing vulnerability to water quality degradation. These studies suggest that event-based recharge processes occurring close to public supply wells may enhance the vulnerability of the wells to surface-sourced contaminants.</abstract><url hash="4b31ccd8">G21-129001</url><pages>7695</pages><doi>10.3390/su13147695</doi><bibkey>Wiebe-2021-Impacts</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="130"><meta><booktitle>Canadian Journal of Forest Research, Volume 51, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>Canadian Science Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Non-uniform growth dynamics of a dominant boreal tree species (&lt;i&gt;Picea mariana&lt;/i&gt;) in the face of rapid climate change</title><author><first>Anastasia E.</first><last>Sniderhan</last></author><author><first>Steven D.</first><last>Mamet</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Northwestern Canada’s boreal forest has experienced rapid warming, drying, and changes to permafrost, yet the growth responses and mechanisms driving productivity have been under-studied at broad scales. Forest responses are largely driven by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) — the region’s most widespread and dominant tree. We collected tree ring samples from four black spruce-dominated sites across 15° of latitude, spanning gradients in climate and permafrost. We investigated (i) differences in growth patterns, (ii) variations in climatic drivers of growth, and (iii) trends in water use efficiency (WUE) through 13 C isotope analysis from 1945 to 2006. We found positive growth trends at all sites except those at mid-latitude, where rapid permafrost thaw drove declines. Annual growth was lowest at the tree limit site and highest at the tree line. Climatic drivers of these growth patterns varied; positive growth responses at the northerly sites were associated with warmer winters, whereas Δ 13 C trends and climate-growth responses at mid-latitude sites indicated that growth was limited by moisture availability. Δ 13 C signatures indicated increased WUE at the southernmost site, with no significant trends at northern sites. These results suggest that warming will increase the growth of trees at the northern extent of black spruce, but southerly areas may face drought stress if precipitation does not balance evapotranspiration.</abstract><url hash="0b59aae2">G21-130001</url><pages>565-572</pages><doi>10.1139/cjfr-2020-0188</doi><bibkey>Sniderhan-2021-Non-uniform</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="131"><meta><booktitle>Weather and Climate Extremes, Volume 34</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>On estimating long period wind speed return levels from annual maxima</title><author><first>M.A.</first><last>Ben Alaya</last></author><author><first>F.W.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>X.</first><last>Zhang</last></author><abstract>The uniform risk engineering practices that are increasingly being adopted for structural design require estimates of the extreme wind loads with very low annual probabilities of exceedance, corresponding to return periods of up to 3000-years in some cases. These estimates are necessarily based on observational wind data that typically spans only a few decades. The estimates are therefore affected by both large sampling uncertainty and, potentially, non-negligible biases. Design practices that aim to meet mandated structural reliability criteria take the sampling uncertainty of long period wind speed or wind pressure estimates into account, but reliability could be compromised if estimates are also biased. In many circumstances, estimates are obtained by fitting an extreme value distribution to annual maximum wind speed observed over a few decades. A key assumption implicit in doing so is that wind speed annual maxima are max-stable. Departures from max-stability can exacerbate the uncertainty of long-period return level estimates by inducing systematic estimation bias as well. Observational records, however, are generally too short to assess max-stability. We therefore use wind speed data from a large (50-member) ensemble of CanRCM4 historical simulations over North America to assess whether wind speed annual maxima are max-stable. While results are generally reassuring at the continental scale, disquieting evidence of a lack of max-stability is often found in the central and southern parts of the continent. Results show that when annual maximum wind speeds are not max-stable, long period return level extreme wind speeds tend to be underestimated, which would compromise reliability if used to design infrastructure such as tall buildings and towers.</abstract><url hash="b3e5cd87">G21-131001</url><pages>100388</pages><doi>10.1016/j.wace.2021.100388</doi><bibkey>Ben Alaya-2021-On</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="132"><meta><booktitle>Weather and Climate Extremes, Volume 33</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Estimating concurrent climate extremes: A conditional approach</title><author><first>Whitney K.</first><last>Huang</last></author><author><first>Adam H.</first><last>Monahan</last></author><author><first>Francis W.</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><abstract>Simultaneous concurrence of extreme values across multiple climate variables can result in large societal and environmental impacts. Therefore, there is growing interest in understanding these concurrent extremes. In many applications, not only the frequency but also the magnitude of concurrent extremes are of interest. One way to approach this problem is to study the distribution of one climate variable given that another is extreme. In this work we develop a statistical framework for estimating bivariate concurrent extremes via a conditional approach, where univariate extreme value modeling is combined with dependence modeling of the conditional tail distribution using techniques from quantile regression and extreme value analysis to quantify concurrent extremes. We focus on the distribution of daily wind speed conditioned on daily precipitation taking its seasonal maximum. The Canadian Regional Climate Model large ensemble is used to assess the performance of the proposed framework both via a simulation study with specified dependence structure and via an analysis of the climate model-simulated dependence structure.</abstract><url hash="a1506269">G21-132001</url><pages>100332</pages><doi>10.1016/j.wace.2021.100332</doi><bibkey>Huang-2021-Estimating</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="133"><meta><booktitle>Atmospheric Research, Volume 257</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Reduction in autumn precipitation over Southwest China by anthropogenic aerosol emissions from eastern China</title><author><first>Fei</first><last>Huo</last></author><author><first>Zhihong</first><last>Jiang</last></author><author><first>Hongyun</first><last>Ma</last></author><author><first>Zhenhua</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><abstract>Impacts of anthropogenic aerosols in China on autumn precipitation over Southwest China were investigated using version 5.1 of the Community Atmosphere Model. Simulations with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions were compared to examine the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on surface air temperature and precipitation in East Asia. Our results show that the aerosol increase induces strong cooling over East Asia by aerosols' direct effect on radiation and indirect effect on clouds. Substantial reductions in precipitation are found across eastern China, but the largest decrease is in Southwest China. Anthropogenic aerosols cause a considerable increase in the cloud condensation nuclei number concentration and a decline in the cloud droplet effective radius in East Asia. The reduced cloud droplet sizes suppress the formation of precipitation and increase cloud depth and liquid water path. Consequently, aerosols' direct radiative effect as well as indirect effect on cloud depth and albedo significantly reduce the shortwave radiation for all sky between 20°and 40°N in China. More absorbing aerosols in the lower troposphere increase shortwave radiative heating, which possibly burns off low-level convective clouds and could cause significant reductions in condensational heating in the lower troposphere. The patterns of the shortwave heating increase and condensational heating reduction are generally consistent with significant reductions in the convective precipitation over China. We further investigated other factors governing precipitation and found moderate stability enhancement and moisture transport reductions in most of China, both of which partially contribute to a decrease in the convective precipitation in Southwest China. Aerosols' direct and indirect effects reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface and cool the surface and lower troposphere between 20° and 40°N, causing anomalous subsidence and reductions in the large-scale precipitation over central and eastern China. Both convective and large-scale precipitation are suppressed over Southwest China, leading to a significant decrease in total precipitation over this area. • Aerosols induce strong cooling by their direct and indirect effects. • The largest decrease in autumn precipitation is found over Southwest China. • Absorbing aerosols increase shortwave heating, reducing low-level convective clouds. • Aerosols' cooling causes subsidence and large-scale precipitation reductions.</abstract><url hash="19ec050c">G21-133001</url><pages>105627</pages><doi>10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.105627</doi><bibkey>Huo-2021-Reduction</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="134"><meta><booktitle>Atmosphere-Ocean, Volume 59, Issue 4-5</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Climate Model Projections for Canada: A Comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6</title><author><first>S.

Ten events with freezing precipitation (including freezing rain and wet snow) over the province of Manitoba, Canada were examined using surface observational datasets, reanalysis products and 4-km resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) products that were both a retrospective control (CTRL) simulation as well as a pseudo-global warming (PGW) simulation. All events tracked to the south and/or east of Manitoba and most (8 of 10) events were associated with a consistent large scale pattern of extratropical cyclone with 500 hPa trough, low surface pressure center nearby, and an atmospheric river. Local factors, such as the 400 m elevated terrain of Riding Mountain, influenced 2 events mainly by altering surface temperature to be favorable for freezing precipitation. These events in the PGW simulation occurred 40–120 km farther north on average, with freezing rain generally being enhanced and wet snow generally being reduced, although wet snow was introduced into events which originally only had freezing rain. This study further showed that power lines aligned west to east, perpendicular to the strongest winds, are most susceptible to the consequences of icing and accretion within the current climate as well as the thermodynamically forced future one. • Freezing rain, wet snow and their mixtures lead to major impacts in Manitoba, Canada. • Ten historic freezing precipitation events over this area are examined in detail. • Freezing precipitation is dramatically altered by the area's low topographic features. • Pseudo-global warming is assumed to examine future freezing precipitation. • With this warming, freezing precipitation types and their locations are altered.</abstract><url hash="3c875ad0">G21-135001</url><pages>105656</pages><doi>10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.105656</doi><bibkey>Tropea-2021-Assessing</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="136"><meta><booktitle>Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 48, Issue 9</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>On the Optimal Design of Field Significance Tests for Changes in Climate Extremes</title><author><first>Jianyu</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Chao</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Francis</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Guilong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Zhihong</first><last>Jiang</last></author><author><first>Panmao</first><last>Zhai</last></author><author><first>Ying</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Zhen</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Qun</first><last>Yue</last></author><abstract /><url hash="2e32f53e">G21-136001</url><doi>10.1029/2021gl092831</doi><bibkey>Wang-2021-On</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="137"><meta><booktitle>Photonics, Volume 8, Issue 10</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Dual-Modality Imaging Microfluidic Cytometer for Onsite Detection of Phytoplankton</title><author><first>Bo</first><last>Xiong</last></author><author><first>Tianqi</first><last>Hong</last></author><author><first>Herbert</first><last>Schellhorn</last></author><author><first>Qiyin</first><last>Fang</last></author><abstract>Phytoplankton monitoring is essential for better understanding and mitigation of phytoplankton bloom formation. We present a microfluidic cytometer with two imaging modalities for onsite detection and identification of phytoplankton: a lensless imaging mode for morphological features, and a fluorescence imaging mode for autofluorescence signal of phytoplankton. Both imaging modes are integrated in a microfluidic device with a field of view (FoV) of 3.7 mm × 2.4 mm and a depth of field (DoF) of 0.8 mm. The particles in the water flow channel can be detected and classified with automated image processing algorithms and machine learning models using their morphology and fluorescence features. The performance of the device was demonstrated by measuring Chlamydomonas, Euglena, and non-fluorescent beads in both separate and mixed flow samples. The recall rates for Chlamydomonas and Euglena ware 93.6% and 94.4%. The dual-modality imaging approach enabled observing both morphology and fluorescence features with a large DoF and FoV which contribute to high-throughput analysis. Moreover, this imaging flow cytometer platform is portable, low-cost, and shows potential in the onsite phytoplankton monitoring.</abstract><url hash="968e925b">G21-137001</url><pages>435</pages><doi>10.3390/photonics8100435</doi><bibkey>Xiong-2021-Dual-Modality</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="138"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrology, Volume 593</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Modelling the impacts of climate and land use change on water security in a semi-arid forested watershed using InVEST</title><author><first>Alireza</first><last>Daneshi</last></author><author><first>Roy</first><last>Brouwer</last></author><author><first>Ali</first><last>Najafinejad</last></author><author><first>Mostafa</first><last>Panahi</last></author><author><first>Ardavan</first><last>Zarandian</last></author><author><first>Fatemeh Fadia</first><last>Maghsood</last></author><abstract>• Water security risks in a watershed are modelled using InVEST’s water yield model. • The impacts of future climate and land use changes on water stress are analyzed. • Water yield is negatively affected by climate change and positively by land use change. • Future water supply is less than the operating flow of a newly constructed dam. • Spatially differentiated conservation efforts are identified to ensure water security. Water security, a key policy objective for sustainable development, is under stress as a result of land use and climate change, especially in (semi-)arid areas like Iran. Land use change alters surface runoff and affects basin-wide hydrological processes and water consumption, while climate change modifies precipitation and temperature patterns and consequently evapotranspiration and water supply.

The novelty of this study is found in the combined modelling of the impacts of climate and land use change scenarios on water security, translating these results into a water stress indicator, and estimating the associated economic costs of reduced future water supply. The results show substantial spatial variation of the negative impacts of water supply and future water security across the watershed, further increasing the pressure on its inhabitants, their economic activities and ecological values.

Modernizing traditional irrigation systems has long been recognized as a means to reduce water losses. However, empirical evidence shows that this practice may not necessarily reduce water use in the long run; in fact, in many cases, the converse is true—a concept known as the rebound phenomenon. This phenomenon is at the heart of a fundamental research gap in the explicit evaluation of co-evolutionary dynamics and interactions among socio-economic and hydrologic factors in agricultural systems. This gap calls for the application of systems-based methods to evaluate such dynamics. To address this gap, we use a previously developed Agent-Based Agricultural Water Demand (ABAD) model, applied to the Bow River Basin (BRB) in Canada. We perform a time-varying variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) on the ABAD model to examine the individual effect of factors, as well as their joint effect, that may give rise to the rebound phenomenon in the BRB. Our results show that economic factors dominantly control possible rebounds. Although social interaction among farmers is found to be less influential than the irrigation expansion factor, its interaction effect with other factors becomes more important, indicating the highly interactive nature of the underlying socio-hydrological system. Based on the insights gained via GSA, we discuss several strategies, including community participation and water restrictions, that can be adopted to avoid the rebound phenomenon in irrigation systems. This study demonstrates that a time-varying variance-based GSA can provide a better understanding of the co-evolutionary dynamics of the socio-hydrological systems and can pave the way for better management of water resources.</abstract><url hash="01c51197">G21-141001</url><pages>126739</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126739</doi><bibkey>Ghoreishi-2021-Peering</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Simulating site-scale permafrost hydrology: Sensitivity to modelling decisions and air temperature</title><author><first>Sebastian A.</first><last>Krogh</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>• Organic layer dry thermal conductivity dominates ground thaw uncertainty. • Significant snowpack and active layer changes are expected under climate warming. • Data poor regions would benefit from pursuing physically based approaches to reduce uncertainty. To predict future hydrological cycling in permafrost-dominated regions requires consideration of complex hydrological interactions that involve cryospheric states and fluxes, and hence thermodynamics. This challenges many hydrological models, particularly those applied in the Arctic. This study presents the implementation and validation of set of algorithms representing permafrost and frozen ground dynamics, coupled into a physically based, modular, cold regions hydrological model at two tundra sites in northern Yukon Territory, Canada. Hydrological processes represented in the model include evapotranspiration, soil moisture dynamics, flow through organic and mineral terrain, ground freeze–thaw, infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils, snowpack energy balance, and the accumulation, wind redistribution, sublimation, and canopy interception of snow. The model was able to successfully represent observed ground surface temperature, ground thaw and snow accumulation at the two sites without calibration. A sensitivity analysis of simulated ground thaw revealed that the soil properties of the upper organic layer dominated the model response; however, its performance was robust for a range of realistic physical parameters. Different modelling decisions were assessed by removing the physically based algorithms for snowpack dynamics and ground surface temperature and replacing them with empirical approaches. Results demonstrate that more physically based approaches should be pursued to reduce uncertainties in poorly monitored environments. Finally, the model was driven by three climate warming scenarios to assess the sensitivity of snow redistribution and ablation processes and ground thaw to warming temperatures. This showed great sensitivity of snow regime and soil thaw to warming, even in the cold continental climate of the northwestern Canadian Arctic. The results are pertinent to transportation infrastructure and water management in this remote, cold, sparsely gauged region where traditional approaches to hydrological prediction are not possible.</abstract><url hash="98cc402d">G21-141002</url><pages>126771</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126771</doi><bibkey>Krogh-2021-Simulating</bibkey></paper><paper id="3"><title>Evapotranspiration and energy partitioning across a forest-shrub vegetation gradient in a subarctic, alpine catchment</title><author><first>Erin M.</first><last>Nicholls</last></author><author><first>Sean K.</first><last>Carey</last></author><abstract>• Boreal forests evaporate considerably more than higher elevation shrub ecosystems. • Forests exist in a growing season water deficit relying on snowmelt recharge. • ET variability declines with increased vegetation cover. • Majority of growing season water for streamflow is generated at higher elevations. • We propose treeline advance will result in drying of northern catchments. As a result of altitude and latitude amplified climate change, widespread changes in vegetation composition, density and distribution have been observed across northern regions. Despite wide documentation of shrub proliferation and treeline advance, few field-based studies have evaluated the hydrological implications of these changes. Quantification of total evapotranspiration (ET) across a range of vegetation gradients is essential for predicting water yield, yet challenging in cold alpine catchments due to heterogeneous land cover, including both boreal forest and shrub taiga ecosystems. Here, we present six years of surface energy balance components and ET dynamics at three sites along an elevational gradient in a subarctic, alpine catchment near Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada. These sites span a gradient of thermal and vegetation regimes, providing a space-for-time comparison for future ecosystem shifts: 1) a low-elevation boreal white spruce forest (~12–20 m), 2) a mid-elevation subalpine taiga comprised of tall, dense willow ( Salix ) and birch ( Betula ) shrubs (~1–3 m) and 3) a high-elevation subalpine taiga with short, sparse shrub cover (&lt;0.75 m) and moss, lichen, and bare rock. Eddy covariance instrumentation ran year-round at the forest and during the growing season at the two shrub sites. Total ET decreased and interannual variability increased with elevation, with mean May to September ET totals of 349 (±3) mm at the forest, 249 (±10) mm at the tall, dense shrub site, and 240 (±26) mm at the short, sparse shrub site. Comparatively, over the same period, ET:R ratios were the highest and most variable at the forest (2.19 ± 0.37) and similar at the tall, dense shrub (1.22 ± 0.09) and short, sparse shrub (1.14 ± 0.05) sites. Our results suggest that advances in treeline will increase overall ET and lower interannual variability; however, the large growing season water deficit at the forest indicates strong reliance on soil moisture from late fall and snowmelt recharge. In contrast, ET was considerably less at the cooler higher elevation shrub sites , which exhibited similar ET losses over 6 years despite differences in shrub height and abundance. ET rates between the two shrub sites were similar throughout the year, except during the peak growing season. Greater interannual variability in ET at the short, sparse shrub site indicates the reduced influence of vegetation controls on ET. Results suggest that predicted changes in vegetation type and structure in northern regions will have a considerable impact on water partitioning and will vary in a complex way in response to changing precipitation timing, phase and magnitude, growing season length, and vegetation snow and rain interactions.</abstract><url hash="efcb70bb">G21-141003</url><pages>126790</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126790</doi><bibkey>Nicholls-2021-Evapotranspiration</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="142"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Modelling &amp;amp; Software, Volume 137</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Future of Sensitivity Analysis: An essential discipline for systems modeling and policy support</title><author><first>Saman</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>Anthony</first><last>Jakeman</last></author><author><first>Andrea</first><last>Saltelli</last></author><author><first>Clémentine</first><last>Prieur</last></author><author><first>Bertrand</first><last>Iooss</last></author><author><first>Emanuele</first><last>Borgonovo</last></author><author><first>Elmar</first><last>Plischke</last></author><author><first>Samuele</first><last>Lo Piano</last></author><author><first>Takuya</first><last>Iwanaga</last></author><author><first>William</first><last>Becker</last></author><author><first>Stefano</first><last>Tarantola</last></author><author><first>Joseph H.A.</first><last>Guillaume</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>Jakeman</last></author><author><first>Hoshin</first><last>Gupta</last></author><author><first>Nicola</first><last>Melillo</last></author><author><first>Giovanni</first><last>Rabitti</last></author><author><first>Vincent</first><last>Chabridon</last></author><author><first>Qingyun</first><last>Duan</last></author><author><first>Xifu</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Stefán</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Razi</first><last>Sheikholeslami</last></author><author><first>Nasim</first><last>Hosseini</last></author><author><first>Masoud</first><last>Asadzadeh</last></author><author><first>Arnald</first><last>Puy</last></author><author><first>Sergei</first><last>Kucherenko</last></author><author><first>Holger R.</first><last>Maier</last></author><abstract>Sensitivity analysis (SA) is en route to becoming an integral part of mathematical modeling.

To develop the maps, several scenarios representing the individual and compounding effects of the models’ input and parameters uncertainty were defined. Hydrologic model calibration and validation were performed using a Dynamically Dimensioned Search algorithm. A generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method was used for quantifying uncertainty. To draw on the potential benefits of the proposed methodology, a flash-flood-prone urban watershed in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, was selected. The developed floodplain maps were updated considering climate change impacts on the input uncertainty with rainfall Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) projections of RCP8.5. The results indicated that the hydrologic model input poses the most uncertainty to floodplain delineation. Incorporating climate change impacts resulted in the expansion of the potential flood area and an increase in water depth. Comparison between stationary and non-stationary IDFs showed that the flood probability is higher when a non-stationary approach is used. The large inevitable uncertainty associated with floodplain mapping and increased future flood risk under climate change imply a great need for enhanced flood modeling techniques and tools. The probabilistic floodplain maps are beneficial for implementing risk management strategies and land-use planning.</abstract><url hash="361be1a5">G21-144001</url><pages>1248</pages><doi>10.3390/w13091248</doi><bibkey>Zahmatkesh-2021-Understanding</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="145"><meta><booktitle>Geocarto International</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Stochastic bias correction for RADARSAT-2 soil moisture retrieved over vegetated areas</title><author><first>Ju Hyoung</first><last>Lee</last></author><author><first>Sujata</first><last>Budhathoki</last></author><author><first>Karl-Erich</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract /><url hash="8ea786c0">G21-145001</url><pages>1-14</pages><doi>10.1080/10106049.2021.2017009</doi><bibkey>Lee-2021-Stochastic</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="146"><meta><booktitle>Water, Volume 13, Issue 21</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Proof-of-Concept of a Quasi-2D Water-Quality Modelling Approach to Simulate Transverse Mixing in Rivers</title><author><first>Pouya</first><last>Sabokruhie</last></author><author><first>Eric</first><last>Akomeah</last></author><author><first>Tammy</first><last>Rosner</last></author><author><first>Karl-Erich</first><last>Lindenschmidt</last></author><abstract>A quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) modelling approach is introduced to mimic transverse mixing of an inflow into a river from one of its banks, either an industrial outfall or a tributary. The concentrations of determinands in the inflow vary greatly from those in the river, leading to very long mixing lengths in the river downstream of the inflow location. Ideally, a two-dimensional (2D) model would be used on a small scale to capture the mixing of the two flow streams. However, for large-scale applications of several hundreds of kilometres of river length, such an approach demands too many computational resources and too much computational time, especially if the application will at some point require ensemble input from climate-change scenario data. However, a one-dimensional (1D) model with variables varying in the longitudinal flow direction but averaged across the cross-sections is too simple of an approach to capture the lateral mixing between different flow streams within the river. Hence, a quasi-2D method is proposed in which a simplified 1D solver is still applied but the discretisation of the model setup can be carried out in such a way as to enable a 2D representation of the model domain. The quasi-2D model setup also allows secondary channels and side lakes in floodplains to be incorporated into the discretisation. To show proof-of-concept, the approach has been tested on a stretch of the lower Athabasca River in Canada flowing through the oil sands region between Fort McMurray and Fort MacKay. A dye tracer and suspended sediments are the constituents modelled in this test case.</abstract><url hash="9c12292e">G21-146001</url><pages>3071</pages><doi>10.3390/w13213071</doi><bibkey>Sabokruhie-2021-Proof-of-Concept</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="147"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Open Source Software, Volume 6, Issue 64</booktitle><publisher>The Open Journal</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>WDPM: the Wetland DEM Ponding Model</title><author><first>Kevin</first><last>Shook</last></author><author><first>Raymond</first><last>Spiteri</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Tonghe</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Oluwaseun</first><last>Sharomi</last></author><abstract /><url hash="24ae4e4b">G21-147001</url><pages>2276</pages><doi>10.21105/joss.02276</doi><bibkey>Shook-2021-WDPM:</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="148"><meta><booktitle>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Volume 25, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The spatial extent of hydrological and landscape changes across the mountains and prairies of Canada in the Mackenzie and Nelson River basins based on data from a warm-season time window</title><author><first>Paul H.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>Philip D.

East of the Continental Divide in the cold interior of Western Canada, the Mackenzie and Nelson River basins have some of the world's most extreme and variable climates, and the warming climate is changing the landscape, vegetation, cryosphere, and hydrology. Available data consist of streamflow records from a large number (395) of natural (unmanaged) gauged basins, where flow may be perennial or temporary, collected either year-round or during only the warm season, for a different series of years between 1910 and 2012. An annual warm-season time window where observations were available across all stations was used to classify (1) streamflow regime and (2) seasonal trend patterns. Streamflow trends were compared to changes in satellite Normalized Difference Indices. Clustering using dynamic time warping, which overcomes differences in streamflow timing due to latitude or elevation, identified 12 regime types. Streamflow regime types exhibit a strong connection to location; there is a strong distinction between mountains and plains and associated with ecozones. Clustering of seasonal trends resulted in six trend patterns that also follow a distinct spatial organization. The trend patterns include one with decreasing streamflow, four with different patterns of increasing streamflow, and one without structure. The spatial patterns of trends in mean, minimum, and maximum of Normalized Difference Indices of water and snow (NDWI and NDSI) were similar to each other but different from Normalized Difference Index of vegetation (NDVI) trends. Regime types, trend patterns, and satellite indices trends each showed spatially coherent patterns separating the Canadian Rockies and other mountain ranges in the west from the poorly defined drainage basins in the east and north. Three specific areas of change were identified: (i) in the mountains and cold taiga-covered subarctic, streamflow and greenness were increasing while wetness and snowcover were decreasing, (ii) in the forested Boreal Plains, particularly in the mountainous west, streamflows and greenness were decreasing but wetness and snowcover were not changing, and (iii) in the semi-arid to sub-humid agricultural Prairies, three patterns of increasing streamflow and an increase in the wetness index were observed. The largest changes in streamflow occurred in the eastern Canadian Prairies.</abstract><url hash="7ccd5e1d">G21-148001</url><pages>2513-2541</pages><doi>10.5194/hess-25-2513-2021</doi><bibkey>Whitfield-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="149"><meta><booktitle>Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie, Volume 70, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Spatially explicit modeling of wetland conservation costs in Canadian agricultural landscapes</title><author><first>Asare</first><last>Eric</last></author><author><first>Lloyd‐Smith</first><last>Patrick</last></author><author><first>Belcher</first><last>Kenneth</last></author><abstract>en</abstract><url hash="c4713978">G21-149001</url><pages>5-19</pages><doi>10.1111/cjag.12301</doi><bibkey>Eric-2021-Spatially</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="150"><meta><booktitle>Groundwater, Volume 60, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Changes in Deep Groundwater Flow Patterns Related to Oil and Gas Activities</title><author><first>Keegan</first><last>Jellicoe</last></author><author><first>Jennifer C.</first><last>McIntosh</last></author><author><first>Grant</first><last>Ferguson</last></author><abstract>Large volumes of saline formation water are both produced from and injected into sedimentary basins as a by-product of oil and gas production. Despite this, the location of production and injection wells has not been studied in detail at the regional scale and the effects on deep groundwater flow patterns (i.e., below the base of groundwater protection) possibly driving fluid flow toward shallow aquifers remain uncertain. Even where injection and production volumes are equal at the basin scale, local changes in hydraulic head can occur due to the distribution of production and injection wells. In the Canadian portion of the Williston Basin, over 4.6 × 109 m3 of water has been co-produced with 5.4 × 108 m3 of oil, and over 5.5 × 109 m3 of water has been injected into the subsurface for salt water disposal or enhanced oil recovery. Despite approximately equal values of produced and injected fluids at the sedimentary basin scale over the history of development, cumulative fluid deficits and surpluses per unit area in excess of a few 100 mm are present at scales of a few 100 km2 . Fluid fluxes associated with oil and gas activities since 1950 likely exceed background groundwater fluxes in these areas. Modeled pressures capable of creating upward hydraulic gradients are predicted for the Midale Member and Mannville Group, two of the strata with the highest amounts of injection in the study area. This could lead to upward leakage of fluids if permeable pathways, such as leaky wells, are present.</abstract><url hash="84195f42">G21-150001</url><pages>47-63</pages><doi>10.1111/gwat.13136</doi><bibkey>Jellicoe-2021-Changes</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="151"><meta><booktitle>Ecological Processes, Volume 10, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Radial variations in xylem sap flux in a temperate red pine plantation forest</title><author><first>Alanna V.</first><last>Bodo</last></author><author><first>M.

Previous studies have shown that much of this uncertainty is related to (i) measurement of sapwood area and (ii) variations in sap flow at different depths within the tree sapwood.This study measured sap flux density at three depth intervals in the sapwood of 88-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa) trees to more accurately estimate water-use at the tree- and stand-level in a plantation forest near Lake Erie in Southern Ontario, Canada. Results showed that most of the water transport (65%) occurred in the outermost sapwood, while only 26% and 9% of water was transported in the middle and innermost depths of sapwood, respectively.These results suggest that failing to consider radial variations in sap flux density within trees can lead to an overestimation of transpiration by as much as 81%, which may cause large uncertainties in water budgets at the ecosystem and catchment scale. This study will help to improve our understanding of water use dynamics and reduce uncertainties in sap flow measurements in the temperate pine forest ecosystems in the Great Lakes region and help in protecting these forests in the face of climate change.</abstract><url hash="3ca53827">G21-151001</url><doi>10.1186/s13717-021-00295-4</doi><bibkey>Bodo-2021-Radial</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="152"><meta><booktitle>Remote Sensing, Volume 13, Issue 20</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Evaluation of Clumping Effects on the Estimation of Global Terrestrial Evapotranspiration</title><author><first>Bin</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Xuehe</first><last>Lu</last></author><author><first>Shaoqiang</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Jing M.</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Yang</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Hongliang</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>Zhenhai</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Fei</first><last>Jiang</last></author><author><first>Muhammad Altaf</first><last>Arain</last></author><author><first>Jinghua</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Xiaobo</first><last>Wang</last></author><abstract>In terrestrial ecosystems, leaves are aggregated into different spatial structures and their spatial distribution is non-random. Clumping index (CI) is a key canopy structural parameter, characterizing the extent to which leaf deviates from the random distribution. To assess leaf clumping effects on global terrestrial ET, we used a global leaf area index (LAI) map and the latest version of global CI product derived from MODIS BRDF data as well as the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) to estimate global terrestrial ET. The results show that global terrestrial ET in 2015 was 511.9 ± 70.1 mm yr−1 for Case I, where the true LAI and CI are used. Compared to this baseline case, (1) global terrestrial ET is overestimated by 4.7% for Case II where true LAI is used ignoring clumping; (2) global terrestrial ET is underestimated by 13.0% for Case III where effective LAI is used ignoring clumping. Among all plant functional types (PFTs), evergreen needleleaf forests were most affected by foliage clumping for ET estimation in Case II, because they are most clumped with the lowest CI. Deciduous broadleaf forests are affected by leaf clumping most in Case III because they have both high LAI and low CI compared to other PFTs. The leaf clumping effects on ET estimation in both Case II and Case III is robust to the errors in major input parameters. Thus, it is necessary to consider clumping effects in the simulation of global terrestrial ET, which has considerable implications for global water cycle research.</abstract><url hash="2e1097c9">G21-152001</url><pages>4075</pages><doi>10.3390/rs13204075</doi><bibkey>Chen-2021-Evaluation</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="153"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, Volume 98</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Species and stand-age driven differences in photochemical reflectance index and light use efficiency across four temperate forests</title><author><first>Shangrong</first><last>Lin</last></author><author><first>Nicholas C.</first><last>Coops</last></author><author><first>Riccardo</first><last>Tortini</last></author><author><first>Wen</first><last>Jia</last></author><author><first>Zoran</first><last>Nesic</last></author><author><first>Eric</first><last>Beamesderfer</last></author><author><first>M.

Photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) determines the ability of a plant to assimilate atmospheric carbon dioxide to biomass and is known to be controlled by environmental conditions, light regimes and forest age. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), derived from leaf or canopy remotely sensed spectra, has been shown to be an effective and accurate estimator of LUE. In this study, we propose a new LUE estimation method that separates the PRI into daily maximal PRI (PRI0) for indicating daily maximal light use efficiency (LUE max ) and ΔPRI, defined as the difference between PRI0 and instantaneous PRI, for estimating the diurnal physiological stress ( fstress) . We develop and apply the method across three temperate pine stands and a deciduous stand of different ages, in Southern Ontario, Canada. Half hourly canopy level spectra were acquired from a tower-based spectro-radiometer system (AMSPEC-III) over the growing season at the four stands. Results show that the PRI0 predicted well LUE max (R 2 &gt; 0.6, p &lt; 0.05) in both coniferous and deciduous stands and was able to track seasonal changes in pigment pools sizes. The ΔPRI was sensitive to short-term meteorological conditions, specifically temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and light variations resulting in strong correlations ( p &lt; 0.05 ) with fstress and half hourly LUE. This new method significantly improves the estimation accuracy (R 2 increases from 0.1 to around 0.7) for PRI-based LUE estimation across all four stands of varying age and species composition and suggests that PRI-based LUE estimation has the ability to inform on both the effects of seasonal and diurnal change in photosynthetic efficiency under different meteorological conditions.</abstract><url hash="96acf0ac">G21-153001</url><pages>102308</pages><doi>10.1016/j.jag.2021.102308</doi><bibkey>Lin-2021-Species</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="154"><meta><booktitle>Ecological Indicators, Volume 129</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Interannual and spatial variability of net ecosystem production in forests explained by an integrated physiological indicator in summer</title><author><first>Ying</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Chaoyang</first><last>Wu</last></author><author><first>Lin</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Chengyan</first><last>Gu</last></author><author><first>T.</first><last>Andrew Black</last></author><author><first>Rachhpal S.</first><last>Jassal</last></author><author><first>Lukas</first><last>Hörtnagl</last></author><author><first>Leonardo</first><last>Montagnani</last></author><author><first>Fernando</first><last>Moyano</last></author><author><first>Andrej</first><last>Varlagin</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Altaf Arain</last></author><author><first>Ajit</first><last>Govind</last></author><abstract>• 514 sites-years of flux data were used to analyze the potential of physiological and phenological metrics in explaining the variability of forest NEP; • Summer physiological metrics performed better than phenological metrics in explaining IAV of NEP; • Ecosystem respiration played an important role in controlling the variability of NEP in forest ecosystem; • MCUI exhibited a great potential in explaining both IAV and SV of NEP. Understanding the feedback of ecosystem carbon uptake on climate change at temporal and spatial scales is crucial for developing ecosystem models. Previous studies have focused on the role of spring and autumn phenology in regulating carbon sequestration in forest stands, but few on the impact of physiological status in summer. However, plant accumulated the most carbon in summer compared with spring and autumn, therefore, it is of great significance to explore the role of summer phenological metrics on the variability of carbon sequestration. Using 514 site-years of flux data obtained at 40 FLUXNET sites including three forest ecosystems (i.e. evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and mixed forest (MF)) in Europe and North America, we compared the potential of physiological and phenological metrics of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (RECO) in explaining the interannual and spatial variability (IAV and SV) of forest net ecosystem production (NEP). In view of the better performance of physiological metrics, we developed the maximum carbon uptake index (MCUI), which integrated the physiology metrics of photosynthesis and respiration in summer, and further explored its ability in explaining the IAV and SV of NEP. The results suggest that the MCUI had a better ability than respiration-growth length ratio (RGR) in predicting NEP for all three forest types. The interpretation of MCUI based on meteorological variables illustrated that the controlling meteorological factors of MCUI differed substantially among ecosystems. The summer shortwave radiation had the greatest influence on MCUI at DBF sites, while the soil water content played an important but opposite role at ENF and DBF sites, and no significant meteorological driver was found at MF sites. The higher potential of MCUI in explaining IAV and SV of NEP highlights the importance of summer physiology in controlling the forest carbon sequestration, and further confirms the significant role of peak plant growth in regulating carbon cycle of forest ecosystems. Understanding the drivers of peak plant growth is therefore of a great significance for further improving the precious of ecosystem model in the future.</abstract><url hash="0b7bc815">G21-154001</url><pages>107982</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107982</doi><bibkey>Liu-2021-Interannual</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="155"><meta><booktitle>Scientific Data, Volume 8, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Author Correction: The FLUXNET2015 dataset and the ONEFlux processing pipeline for eddy covariance data</title><author><first>Gilberto</first><last>Pastorello</last></author><author><first>Carlo</first><last>Trotta</last></author><author><first>Eleonora</first><last>Canfora</last></author><author><first>Housen</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>Danielle</first><last>Christianson</last></author><author><first>You-Wei</first><last>Cheah</last></author><author><first>Cristina</first><last>Poindexter</last></author><author><first>Jiquan</first><last>Chen</last></author><author><first>Abdelrahman</first><last>Elbashandy</last></author><author><first>Marty</first><last>Humphrey</last></author><author><first>Peter</first><last>Isaac</last></author><author><first>Diego</first><last>Polidori</last></author><author><first>Markus</first><last>Reichstein</last></author><author><first>Alessio</first><last>Ribeca</last></author><author><first>Catharine</first><last>van Ingen</last></author><author><first>Nicolas</first><last>Vuichard</last></author><author><first>Leiming</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Brian</first><last>Amiro</last></author><author><first>Christof</first><last>Ammann</last></author><author><first>M.

Plant transpiration links physiological responses of vegetation to water supply and demand with hydrological, energy, and carbon budgets at the land–atmosphere interface. However, despite being the main land evaporative flux at the global scale, transpiration and its response to environmental drivers are currently not well constrained by observations. Here we introduce the first global compilation of whole-plant transpiration data from sap flow measurements (SAPFLUXNET, https://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat/, last access: 8 June 2021). We harmonized and quality-controlled individual datasets supplied by contributors worldwide in a semi-automatic data workflow implemented in the R programming language. Datasets include sub-daily time series of sap flow and hydrometeorological drivers for one or more growing seasons, as well as metadata on the stand characteristics, plant attributes, and technical details of the measurements. SAPFLUXNET contains 202 globally distributed datasets with sap flow time series for 2714 plants, mostly trees, of 174 species. SAPFLUXNET has a broad bioclimatic coverage, with woodland/shrubland and temperate forest biomes especially well represented (80 % of the datasets). The measurements cover a wide variety of stand structural characteristics and plant sizes. The datasets encompass the period between 1995 and 2018, with 50 % of the datasets being at least 3 years long. Accompanying radiation and vapour pressure deficit data are available for most of the datasets, while on-site soil water content is available for 56 % of the datasets. Many datasets contain data for species that make up 90 % or more of the total stand basal area, allowing the estimation of stand transpiration in diverse ecological settings. SAPFLUXNET adds to existing plant trait datasets, ecosystem flux networks, and remote sensing products to help increase our understanding of plant water use, plant responses to drought, and ecohydrological processes. SAPFLUXNET version 0.1.5 is freely available from the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971689; Poyatos et al., 2020a). The “sapfluxnetr” R package – designed to access, visualize, and process SAPFLUXNET data – is available from CRAN.</abstract><url hash="a172009e">G21-156001</url><pages>2607-2649</pages><doi>10.5194/essd-13-2607-2021</doi><bibkey>Poyatos-2021-Global</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="157"><meta><booktitle>Ecological Indicators, Volume 120</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Sensitivity of vegetation dynamics to climate variability in a forest-steppe transition ecozone, north-eastern Inner Mongolia, China</title><author><first>Guangyong</first><last>You</last></author><author><first>Bo</first><last>Liu</last></author><author><first>Changxin</first><last>Zou</last></author><author><first>Haidong</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Shawn</first><last>McKenzie</last></author><author><first>Yaqian</first><last>He</last></author><author><first>Jixi</first><last>Gao</last></author><author><first>Xiru</first><last>Jia</last></author><author><first>M.</first><last>Altaf Arain</last></author><author><first>Shusen</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Zhi</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Xin</first><last>Xia</last></author><author><first>Wanggu</first><last>Xu</last></author><abstract>Abstract Climate change and land use management were competing explanations for vegetation dynamics in cold and semi-arid region of north-eastern Inner Mongolia, China. In order to reveal the role of human disturbance and clarify the regional climate-vegetation relationship, long-term (1982–2013) datasets of climate variables and vegetation dynamics in a forest-steppe transition zone of north-eastern Inner Mongolia, China were collected. Partial correlation analyses, principal components regression (PCR), and residual analyses were conducted to reveal the vegetation sensitivities to different climate variables and the impact of anthropogenic activities on climate-vegetation relationship. The results showed that. (1) Annual mean air temperature (TMP) significantly increased at a linear slope of 0.08 °C per decade, annual precipitation (PRE) had an insignificantly linear slope of −16.42 mm per decade (p = 0.15). The average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) had a significantly negative trend over the past decades. A change point around the year 1998, coincided with the occurrence of an intense global El Nino event was also identified. (2) Regional climate change can be represented by changes in temperature, humidity and radiation. NDVI in the steppes display high sensitivity to moisture availability. Whereas, forests was influenced by the warmth index (WMI), accumulation of monthly temperature above a threshold of 5 °C. Partial correlation analyses showed that pixels of positive correlation with PRE (controlling TMP) overlap with the pixels of high partial correlation with minimum temperature (controlling maximum temperature), which suggests a hidden link between minimum temperature and PRE in this region. (3) The spatial distribution of significantly decreased NDVI overlap with cropland expansion, as well as the low residual square (R2) from PCR analysis. The NDVI decline in these expanded croplands suggests human disturbance on vegetation dynamics. Following climate warming, NDVI of forested land displayed positive trend. Whereas, most of steppe displayed negative trend, possibly resulting from combined effects of climate drying and human disturbance. We conclude that the regional climate change can be characterized as warming and drying. Steppe areas were sensitive to humidity changes while forested land was mostly influenced by growing season warmth. Overall, the regional NDVI displayed significantly negative trend over the past decades. Beyond climate drying, cropland expansion in the transition area between grassland and forested land is also an important driver for decreased NDVI. Further studies on the ecological and hydrological consequences of crop land expansion is necessary.</abstract><url hash="19ce67fb">G21-157001</url><pages>106833</pages><doi>10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106833</doi><bibkey>You-2021-Sensitivity</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="158"><meta><booktitle>Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volume 310</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Seasonality in aerodynamic resistance across a range of North American ecosystems</title><author><first>Adam M.</first><last>Young</last></author><author><first>Mark A.</first><last>Friedl</last></author><author><first>Bijan</first><last>Seyednasrollah</last></author><author><first>Eric</first><last>Beamesderfer</last></author><author><first>Carlos M.</first><last>Carrillo</last></author><author><first>Xiaolu</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Minkyu</first><last>Moon</last></author><author><first>M.

Surface roughness – a key control on land-atmosphere exchanges of heat and momentum – differs between dormant and growing seasons. However, how surface roughness shifts seasonally at fine time scales (e.g., days) in response to changing canopy conditions is not well understood. This study: (1) explores how aerodynamic resistance changes seasonally; (2) investigates what drives these seasonal shifts, including the role of vegetation phenology; and (3) quantifies the importance of including seasonal changes of aerodynamic resistance in “big leaf” models of sensible heat flux ( H ). We evaluated aerodynamic resistance and surface roughness lengths for momentum ( z 0m ) and heat ( z 0h ) using the kB −1 parameter (ln( z 0m / z 0h )). We used AmeriFlux data to obtain surface-roughness estimates, and PhenoCam greenness data for phenology. This analysis included 23 sites and ∼190 site years from deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf, woody savanna, cropland, grassland, and shrubland plant-functional types (PFTs). Results indicated clear seasonal patterns in aerodynamic resistance to sensible heat transfer ( R ah ). This seasonality tracked PhenoCam-derived start-of-season green-up transitions in PFTs displaying the most significant seasonal changes in canopy structure, with R ah decreasing near green-up transitions. Conversely, in woody savanna sites and evergreen needleleaf forests, patterns in R ah were not linked to green-up. Our findings highlight that decreases in kB −1 are an important control over R ah , explaining &gt; 50% of seasonal variation in R ah across most sites. Decreases in kB −1 during green-up are likely caused by increasing z 0h in response to higher leaf area index. Accounting for seasonal variation in kB −1 is key for predicting H as well; assuming kB −1 to be constant resulted in significant biases that also exhibited strong seasonal patterns. Overall, we found that aerodynamic resistance can be sensitive to phenology in ecosystems having strong seasonality in leaf area, and this linkage is critical for understanding land-atmosphere interactions at seasonal time scales.</abstract><url hash="41ad77ad">G21-158001</url><pages>108613</pages><doi>10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108613</doi><bibkey>Young-2021-Seasonality</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="159"><meta><booktitle>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, Volume 4</booktitle><publisher>Frontiers Media SA</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Impact of Variable Retention Harvesting on Growth and Carbon Sequestration of a Red Pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)

Variable retention harvesting (VRH) has been suggested to be a potential method to increase forest biodiversity, growth, and carbon (C) sequestration. A field trial was established in an 88-year-old red pine ( Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation in southern Ontario, Canada, using a completely randomized design to examine the response of tree productivity and other forest values to five harvesting treatments: 33% aggregate retention (33A), 55% aggregate retention (55A), 33% dispersed retention (33D), and 55% dispersed retention (55D) in comparison to an unharvested control (CN). In this study, we explored the impacts of VRH on aboveground stem radial growth and annual C increment. Standard dendrochronological methods and allometric equations were used to quantify tree- and stand-level treatment effects during a five-year pre-harvest (2009–2013) and post-harvest (2014–2018) period. Tree-level growth and C increment were increased by the dispersed retention pattern regardless of retention level. At the stand level, the total C increment was highest at greater retention levels and did not vary with retention pattern. These results suggest that the choice of retention level and pattern can have a large influence on management objectives as they relate to timber production, climate change adaptation, and/or climate change mitigation.</abstract><url hash="f91110c8">G21-159001</url><doi>10.3389/ffgc.2021.725890</doi><bibkey>Zugic-2021-The</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Corrigendum: Identifying Functional Impacts of Heat-Resistant Fungi on Boreal Forest Recovery After Wildfire</title><author><first>Nicola J.</first><last>Day</last></author><author><first>Steven G.</first><last>Cumming</last></author><author><first>Kari E.</first><last>Dunfield</last></author><author><first>Jill F.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>Michelle C.</first><last>Mack</last></author><author><first>Kirsten A.</first><last>Reid</last></author><author><first>Merritt R.</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><author><first>Xanthe J.</first><last>Walker</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><abstract>Day, N.

While climate change is a concern to all Canadians, Indigenous communities in Canada have been disproportionately more affected by these extreme climate events than non-Indigenous communities. As the impacts of climate change intensify, it becomes increasingly important that high-resolution climate services are made available to Indigenous decision makers for the development of climate change adaptation plans. This paper examined extreme climate trends in the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the most populated Indigenous community in Canada. A set of 12 indices were used to evaluate changes in extreme climate events from 1951 to 2013, and 2006 to 2099 under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Results indicated that from 1951 to 2013, Six Nations became warmer and wetter with an average temperature increase of 0.7 °C and precipitation increase of 42 mm. Over this period, the frequency and duration of extreme heat and extreme precipitation events also increased, while extreme cold events decreased. In the future (2006 to 2099), temperature is expected to increase by 3 to 6 °C, while seasonal precipitation is expected to increase in winter, early spring, and fall. Projected rate of increase of heatwaves is 0.4 to 1.5 days per year and extreme annual rainfall events is 0.2 to 0.5 mm per year under both RCP scenarios. The climate information and data provide by this study will help Six Nations’ decision makers in planning for climate change impacts.</abstract><url hash="c3b92592">G21-160001</url><pages>100263</pages><doi>10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100263</doi><bibkey>Deen-2021-Evaluation</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="161"><meta><booktitle>Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volume 301-302</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Representativeness of Eddy-Covariance flux footprints for areas surrounding AmeriFlux sites</title><author><first>Housen</first><last>Chu</last></author><author><first>Xiangzhong</first><last>Luo</last></author><author><first>Zutao</first><last>Ouyang</last></author><author><first>W.

This study addresses one of the major challenges facing model-data integration: To what spatial extent do flux measurements taken at individual eddy-covariance sites reflect model- or satellite-based grid cells? We evaluate flux footprints—the temporally dynamic source areas that contribute to measured fluxes—and the representativeness of these footprints for target areas (e.g., within 250–3000 m radii around flux towers) that are often used in flux-data synthesis and modeling studies. We examine the land-cover composition and vegetation characteristics, represented here by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the flux footprints and target areas across 214 AmeriFlux sites, and evaluate potential biases as a consequence of the footprint-to-target-area mismatch. Monthly 80% footprint climatologies vary across sites and through time ranging four orders of magnitude from 10 3 to 10 7 m 2 due to the measurement heights, underlying vegetation- and ground-surface characteristics, wind directions, and turbulent state of the atmosphere. Few eddy-covariance sites are located in a truly homogeneous landscape. Thus, the common model-data integration approaches that use a fixed-extent target area across sites introduce biases on the order of 4%–20% for EVI and 6%–20% for the dominant land cover percentage. These biases are site-specific functions of measurement heights, target area extents, and land-surface characteristics. We advocate that flux datasets need to be used with footprint awareness, especially in research and applications that benchmark against models and data products with explicit spatial information. We propose a simple representativeness index based on our evaluations that can be used as a guide to identify site-periods suitable for specific applications and to provide general guidance for data use.</abstract><url hash="7b0542f7">G21-161001</url><pages>108350</pages><doi>10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108350</doi><bibkey>Chu-2021-Representativeness</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="162"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Risk Research, Volume 24, Issue 3-4</booktitle><publisher>Informa UK Limited</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>COVID-19 risk perception: a longitudinal analysis of its predictors and associations with health protective behaviours in the United Kingdom</title><author><first>Claudia R.</first><last>Schneider</last></author><author><first>Sarah</first><last>Dryhurst</last></author><author><first>John</first><last>Kerr</last></author><author><first>Alexandra L.

The impacts associated with blooms, however, vary across Nation states, as do the strategies and protocols to assess, monitor, and manage their occurrence. In Canada, water quality guidelines are standardized nationally, but the management strategies for HABs are not. Here, we explore current strategies to understand how to better communicate risks associated with HABs to the public. Our team conducted an environmental scan on provincial and territorial government agency protocols around HABs. Results suggest that there are variations in the monitoring, managing, and communicating of risk to the public: British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec have well-established inter-agency protocols, and most provinces report following federal guidelines for water quality. Notably, 3 northern territories have no HABs monitoring or management protocols in place. More populous provinces use a variety of information venues (websites, social media, on site postings, and radio) to communicate risks associated with HABs, whereas others’ communications are limited. To induce more collaboration on HABs monitoring and management and reduce the associated risks, creating a coherent system with consistent messaging and inter-agency communication is suggested.</abstract><url hash="d10c8a7c">G21-163001</url><pages>117863022110144</pages><doi>10.1177/11786302211014401</doi><bibkey>Rashidi-2021-Monitoring,</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="164"><meta><booktitle>Science of The Total Environment, Volume 764</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Glacier recession alters stream water quality characteristics facilitating bloom formation in the benthic diatom Didymosphenia geminata</title><author><first>J.</first><last>Brahney</last></author><author><first>M.L.</first><last>Bothwell</last></author><author><first>L.</first><last>Capito</last></author><author><first>C.A.</first><last>Gray</last></author><author><first>S.E.</first><last>Null</last></author><author><first>B.</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>P.J.</first><last>Curtis</last></author><abstract>Glaciers provide cold, turbid runoff to many mountain streams in the late summer and buffer against years with low snowfall. The input of glacial meltwater to streams maintains unique habitats and support a diversity of stream flora and fauna. In western Canada, glaciers are anticipated to retreat by 60–80% by the end of the century, and this retreat will invoke widespread changes in mountain ecosystems. We used a space-for-time substitution along a gradient of glacierization in western Canada to develop insights into changes that may occur in glaciated regions over the coming decades. Here we report on observed changes in physical (temperature, turbidity), and chemical (dissolved and total nutrients) characteristics of mountain streams and the associated shifts in their diatom communities during de-glacierization. Shifts in habitat characteristics across gradients include changes in nutrient concentrations, light penetration, temperatures, and flow, all of which have led to distinct changes in diatom community composition. Importantly, glacial-fed rivers were 3–5 °C cooler than rivers without glacial contributions. Declines in glacial meltwater contribution to streams resulted in shifts in the timing of nutrient fluxes and lower concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and light penetration. The above set of conditions were linked to the overgrowth of the benthic diatom Didymosphenia geminata . These changes in stream condition and D. geminata colony development primarily occurred in streams with marginal (2–5%) to no glacier cover. Our data support a hypothesis that climate-induced changes in river hydrochemistry and physical condition lead to a phenological mismatch that favors D. geminata bloom development. • We use a space-for-time substitution to examine glacier recession impacts on rivers. • Temperature changes through time and by season were greatest in glacierized systems. • Peaks in turbidity and nutrients decreased and shifted to earlier in the year. • These shifts cause a phenological mismatch that favors D. geminata colony formation.</abstract><url hash="4cdbb2c5">G21-164001</url><pages>142856</pages><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142856</doi><bibkey>Brahney-2021-Glacier</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="165"><meta><booktitle>Global Change Biology, Volume 27, Issue 8</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms: Overlooked climate refugia for mountain biodiversity</title><author><first>Stefano</first><last>Brighenti</last></author><author><first>Scott</first><last>Hotaling</last></author><author><first>Debra S.</first><last>Finn</last></author><author><first>Andrew G.</first><last>Fountain</last></author><author><first>Masaki</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>David</first><last>Herbst</last></author><author><first>Jasmine E.</first><last>Saros</last></author><author><first>Lusha M.</first><last>Tronstad</last></author><author><first>Constance I.</first><last>Millar</last></author><abstract>Mountains are global biodiversity hotspots where cold environments and their associated ecological communities are threatened by climate warming. Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the ecological effects of alpine glacier and snowfield recession. However, much less attention has been given to identifying climate refugia in mountain ecosystems where present-day environmental conditions will be maintained, at least in the near-term, as other habitats change. Around the world, montane communities of microbes, animals, and plants live on, adjacent to, and downstream of rock glaciers and related cold rocky landforms (CRL). These geomorphological features have been overlooked in the ecological literature despite being extremely common in mountain ranges worldwide with a propensity to support cold and stable habitats for aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. CRLs are less responsive to atmospheric warming than alpine glaciers and snowfields due to the insulating nature and thermal inertia of their debris cover paired with their internal ventilation patterns. Thus, CRLs are likely to remain on the landscape after adjacent glaciers and snowfields have melted, thereby providing longer-term cold habitat for biodiversity living on and downstream of them. Here, we show that CRLs will likely act as key climate refugia for terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in mountain ecosystems, offer guidelines for incorporating CRLs into conservation practices, and identify areas for future research.</abstract><url hash="f467d5a0">G21-165001</url><pages>1504-1517</pages><doi>10.1111/gcb.15510</doi><bibkey>Brighenti-2021-Rock</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="166"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, Volume 126, Issue 6</booktitle><publisher>American Geophysical Union (AGU)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Icefield Breezes: Mesoscale Diurnal Circulation in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Over an Outlet of the Columbia Icefield, Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>J.

Shading in such environments can help regulate downstream flow over the course of a growing season, but our knowledge on how shadows impact the energy budget and consequently ecohydrology in montane ecosystems is very limited. We investigated the influence of horizon shade on the surface energy fluxes of a subalpine headwater wetland in the Canadian Rocky Mountains during the growing season. During the study, surface insolation decreased by 60% (32% due to evolving horizon shade and 28% from seasonality). The influence of shade on the energy budget varied between two distinct periods: (1) Stable Shade, when horizon shade was constant and reduced sunlight by 2 h per day; and (2) Dynamic Shade, when shade increased and reduced sunlight by 0.18 h more each day, equivalent to a 13% reduction in incoming shortwave radiation and 16% in net radiation. Latent heat flux, the dominant energy flux at our site, varied temporally because of changes in incoming radiation, atmospheric demand, soil moisture and shade. Horizon shade controlled soil moisture at our site by prolonging snowmelt and reducing evapotranspiration in the late growing season, resulting in increased water storage capacity compared to other mountain wetlands. With the mounting risk of climate-change-driven severe spring flooding and late season droughts downstream of mountain headwaters, shaded subalpine wetlands provide important ecohydrological and mitigation services that are worthy of further study and mapping. This will help us better understand and protect mountain and prairie water resources.</abstract><url hash="5e6e1d2b">G21-167001</url><pages>1473</pages><doi>10.3390/atmos12111473</doi><bibkey>Hrach-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="168"><meta><booktitle>Nature, Volume 592, Issue 7856</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Accelerated global glacier mass loss in the early twenty-first century</title><author><first>Romain</first><last>Hugonnet</last></author><author><first>Robert</first><last>McNabb</last></author><author><first>Etienne</first><last>Berthier</last></author><author><first>Brian</first><last>Menounos</last></author><author><first>Christopher</first><last>Nuth</last></author><author><first>Luc</first><last>Girod</last></author><author><first>Daniel</first><last>Farinotti</last></author><author><first>Matthias</first><last>Huss</last></author><author><first>Ines</first><last>Dussaillant</last></author><author><first>Fanny</first><last>Brun</last></author><author><first>Andreas</first><last>Kääb</last></author><abstract>Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth's glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000-2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7-9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.</abstract><url hash="060d0d7d">G21-168001</url><pages>726-731</pages><doi>10.1038/s41586-021-03436-z</doi><bibkey>Hugonnet-2021-Accelerated</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="169"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Research Communications, Volume 3, Issue 7</booktitle><publisher>IOP Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Rapid shrub expansion in a subarctic mountain basin revealed by repeat airborne LiDAR</title><author><first>Sean C</first><last>Leipe</last></author><author><first>Sean K</first><last>Carey</last></author><abstract>Abstract As a consequence of increasing temperatures, a rapid increase in shrub vegetation has occurred throughout the circumpolar North and is expected to continue. Rates of shrub expansion are highly variable, both at the regional scale and within local study areas. This study uses repeat airborne LiDAR and field surveys to measure changes in shrub vegetation cover along with landscape-scale variations in a well-studied subarctic headwater catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada. Airborne LiDAR surveys were conducted in August 2007 and 2018, whereas vegetation surveys were conducted in summer 2019. Machine learning classification algorithms were used to predict shrub presence/absence in 2018 based on rasterized LiDAR metrics, with the best-performing model applied to the 2007 LiDAR to create binary shrub cover layers to compare between survey years. Results show a 63.3% total increase in detectable shrub cover &amp;gt;= 0.45 m in height between 2007 and 2018, with an average yearly expansion of 5.8%. These changes were compared across terrain derivatives to quantify the influence of topography on shrub expansion. Terrain comparisons show that shrubs are located in and are preferentially expanding into lower and flatter areas near stream networks, at lower slope positions and with a higher potential for topographic wetness. Overall, the findings from this research reinforce the documented increase in pan-Arctic shrub vegetation in recent years, quantify the variation in shrub expansion over terrain derivatives at the landscape scale, and demonstrate the feasibility of using LiDAR to compare changes in shrub properties over time.</abstract><url hash="beb16a18">G21-169001</url><pages>071001</pages><doi>10.1088/2515-7620/ac0e0c</doi><bibkey>Leipe-2021-Rapid</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="170"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Hydrometeorology, Volume 22, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Improvement of Snow Gauge Collection Efficiency through a Knowledge of Solid Precipitation Fall Speed</title><author><first>Nicolas R.</first><last>Leroux</last></author><author><first>Julie M.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>Roy</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><abstract>Abstract The collection efficiency of a typical precipitation gauge-shield configuration decreases with increasing wind speed, with a high scatter for a given wind speed. The high scatter in the collection efficiency for a given wind speed arises in part from the variability in the characteristics of falling snow and atmospheric turbulence. This study uses weighing gauge data collected at the Marshall Field Site near Boulder, Colorado, during the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE). Particle diameter and fall speed data from a laser disdrometer were used to show that the scatter in the collection efficiency can be reduced by considering the fall speed of solid precipitation particles. The collection efficiency was divided into two classes depending on the measured mean-event particle fall speed during precipitation events. Slower-falling particles were associated with a lower collection efficiency. A new transfer function (i.e., the relationship between collection efficiency and other meteorological variables, such as wind speed or air temperature) that includes the fall speed of the hydrometeors was developed. The root-mean-square error of the adjusted precipitation with the new transfer function with respect to a weighing gauge placed in a double fence intercomparison reference was lower than using previously developed transfer functions that only consider wind speed and air temperature. This shows that the measured fall speed of solid precipitation with a laser disdrometer accounts for a large amount of the observed scatter in weighing gauge collection efficiency.</abstract><url hash="fed90c22">G21-170001</url><pages>997-1006</pages><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-20-0147.1</doi><bibkey>Leroux-2021-Improvement</bibkey></paper><paper id="2"><title>Improvement of Solid Precipitation Measurements Using a Hotplate Precipitation Gauge</title><author><first>Julie M.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>Nicolas R.</first><last>Leroux</last></author><author><first>Roy M.</first><last>Rasmussen</last></author><abstract>Abstract Accurate snowfall measurement is challenging because it depends on the precipitation gauge used, meteorological conditions, and the precipitation microphysics. Upstream of weighing gauges, the flow field is disturbed by the gauge and any shielding used usually creates an updraft, which deflects solid precipitation from falling in the gauge, resulting in significant undercatch. Wind shields are often used with weighing gauges to reduce this updraft, and transfer functions are required to adjust the snowfall measurements to consider gauge undercatch. Using these functions reduces the bias in precipitation measurement but not the root-mean-square error (RMSE). In this study, the accuracy of the Hotplate precipitation gauge was compared to standard unshielded and shielded weighing gauges collected during the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment program. The analysis performed in this study shows that the Hotplate precipitation gauge bias after wind correction is near zero and similar to wind corrected weighing gauges. The RMSE of the Hotplate precipitation gauge measurements is lower than weighing gauges (with or without an Alter shield) for wind speeds up to 5 m s −1 , the wind speed limit at which sufficient data were available. This study shows that the Hotplate precipitation gauge measurement has a low bias and RMSE due to its aerodynamic shape, making its performance mostly independent of the type of solid precipitation.</abstract><url hash="67d05d98">G21-170002</url><pages>877-885</pages><doi>10.1175/jhm-d-20-0168.1</doi><bibkey>Thériault-2021-Improvement</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="171"><meta><booktitle>Water, Volume 13, Issue 7</booktitle><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Thermal Characteristics of a Beaver Dam Analogues Equipped Spring-Fed Creek in the Canadian Rockies</title><author><first>Tariq</first><last>Munir</last></author><author><first>Cherie</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are becoming an increasingly popular stream restoration technique. One ecological function BDAs might help restore is suitable habitat conditions for fish in streams where loss of beaver dams and channel incision has led to their decline. A critical physical characteristic for fish is stream temperature. We examined the thermal regime of a spring-fed Canadian Rocky Mountain stream in relation to different numbers of BDAs installed in series over three study periods (April–October; 2017–2019). While all BDA configurations significantly influenced stream and pond temperatures, single- and double-configuration BDAs incrementally increased stream temperatures. Single and double configuration BDAs warmed the downstream waters of mean maxima of 9.9, 9.3 °C by respective mean maxima of 0.9 and 1.0 °C. Higher pond and stream temperatures occurred when ponding and discharge decreased, and vice versa. In 2019, variation in stream temperature below double-configuration BDAs was lower than the single-configuration BDA. The triple-configuration BDA, in contrast, cooled the stream, although the mean maximum stream temperature was the highest below these structures. Ponding upstream of BDAs increased discharge and resulted in cooling of the stream. Rainfall events sharply and transiently reduced stream temperatures, leading to a three-way interaction between BDA configuration, rainfall and stream discharge as factors co-influencing the stream temperature regime. Our results have implications for optimal growth of regionally important and threatened bull and cutthroat trout fish species.</abstract><url hash="46656b47">G21-171001</url><pages>990</pages><doi>10.3390/w13070990</doi><bibkey>Munir-2021-Thermal</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="172"><meta><booktitle>Frontiers in Earth Science, Volume 9</booktitle><publisher>Frontiers Media SA</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Surface Mass-Balance Gradients From Elevation and Ice Flux Data in the Columbia Basin, Canada</title><author><first>Ben M.</first><last>Pelto</last></author><author><first>Brian</first><last>Menounos</last></author><abstract>The mass-balance—elevation relation for a given glacier is required for many numerical models of ice flow. Direct measurements of this relation using remotely-sensed methods are complicated by ice dynamics, so observations are currently limited to glaciers where surface mass-balance measurements are routinely made. We test the viability of using the continuity equation to estimate annual surface mass balance between flux-gates in the absence of in situ measurements, on five glaciers in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Repeat airborne laser scanning surveys of glacier surface elevation, ice penetrating radar surveys and publicly available maps of ice thickness are used to estimate changes in surface elevation and ice flux. We evaluate this approach by comparing modeled to observed mass balance. Modeled mass-balance gradients well-approximate those obtained from direct measurement of surface mass balance, with a mean difference of +6.6 &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="m1"&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;±&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; 4%. Regressing modeled mass balance, equilibrium line altitudes are on average 15 m higher than satellite-observations of the transient snow line. Estimates of mass balance over flux bins compare less favorably than the gradients. Average mean error (+0.03 &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="m2"&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;±&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; 0.07 m w.e.) between observed and modeled mass balance over flux bins is relatively small, yet mean absolute error (0.55 &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="m3"&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;±&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; 0.18 m w.e.) and average modeled mass-balance uncertainty (0.57 m w.e.) are large. Mass conservation, assessed with glaciological data, is respected (when estimates are within 1σ uncertainties) for 84% of flux bins representing 86% of total glacier area. Uncertainty on ice velocity, especially for areas where surface velocity is low (&amp;amp;lt;10 m a −1 ) contributes the greatest error in estimating ice flux. We find that using modeled ice thicknesses yields comparable modeled mass-balance gradients relative to using observations of ice thickness, but we caution against over-interpreting individual flux-bin mass balances due to large mass-balance residuals. Given the performance of modeled ice thickness and the increasing availability of ice velocity and surface topography data, we suggest that similar efforts to produce mass-balance gradients using modern high-resolution datasets are feasible on larger scales.</abstract><url hash="54d0c4a9">G21-172001</url><doi>10.3389/feart.2021.675681</doi><bibkey>Pelto-2021-Surface</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="173"><meta><booktitle>Science of The Total Environment, Volume 785</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Beaver dams: How structure, flow state, and landscape setting regulate water storage and release</title><author><first>Amanda L.</first><last>Ronnquist</last></author><author><first>Cherie J.</first><last>Westbrook</last></author><abstract>Beaver ( Castor canadensis and Castor fiber ) are regarded widely as ecosystem engineers and the dams they create are well-known for their ability to drastically alter the hydrology of rivers. As a result, beaver are increasingly being included in green infrastructure practices to combat the effects of climate change and enhance ecosystem resilience. Both drought and flood mitigation capabilities have been observed in watersheds with beaver dam structures; however, how dams possess contrasting mitigation abilities is not fully understood since most studies neglect to acknowledge variation in beaver dam structures. In this study, an extensive cross-site survey of the physical and hydrologic properties of beaver dams was conducted in the Canadian Rocky Mountains in Alberta. This research aimed to improve the understanding of the hydrology of beaver dams by categorizing dams using their intrinsic properties and landscape settings to identify fundamental patterns that may be applicable across landscape types. The dam flow type classification from Woo and Waddington (1990) was evaluated in this new context and adapted to include two new flow types. The survey of intrinsic beaver dam properties revealed significant differences in dam structure across different sites. Physical differences in dam structure altered the dynamics and variance of pond storage and certain dam attributes related to the landscape setting. For instance, dam material influenced dam height and water source influenced dam length. However, a closer analysis of large rain events showed that the physical structure of dams alters seasonal dynamics of pond storage but not the response to rain events. Overall, this research shows that beaver dams can be both structurally and hydrologically very different from each other. Establishing broadly applicable classifications is vital to understanding the ecosystem resilience and mitigation services beaver dams provide. • Beaver dams in Canadian Rockies are highly diverse structurally and hydrologically. • Beaver dams can be classified by their flow state. • Dam flow state relates to dam physical structure and landscape setting. • Dam hydrological effectiveness depends on flow state. • Important implications for nature-based solutions to climate change.</abstract><url hash="ec6ca3cc">G21-173001</url><pages>147333</pages><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147333</doi><bibkey>Ronnquist-2021-Beaver</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="174"><meta><booktitle>Frontiers in Water, Volume 3</booktitle><publisher>Frontiers Media SA</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Role of Basin Geometry in Mountain Snowpack Responses to Climate Change</title><author><first>Joseph M.</first><last>Shea</last></author><author><first>Paul H.</first><last>Whitfield</last></author><author><first>Xing</first><last>Fang</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><abstract>Snowmelt contributions to streamflow in mid-latitude mountain basins typically dominate other runoff sources on annual and seasonal timescales. Future increases in temperature and changes in precipitation will affect both snow accumulation and seasonal runoff timing and magnitude, but the underlying and fundamental roles of mountain basin geometry and hypsometry on snowmelt sensitivity have received little attention. To investigate the role of basin geometry in snowmelt sensitivity, a linear snow accumulation model and the Cold Regions Hydrological Modeling (CRHM) platform driven are used to estimate how hypsometry affects basin-wide snow volumes and snowmelt runoff. Area-elevation distributions for fifty basins in western Canada were extracted, normalized according to their elevation statistics, and classified into three clusters that represent top-heavy, middle, and bottom-heavy basins. Prescribed changes in air temperature alter both the snow accumulation gradient and the total snowmelt energy, leading to snowpack volume reductions (10–40%), earlier melt onsets (1–4 weeks) and end of melt season (3 weeks), increases in early spring melt rates and reductions in seasonal areal melt rates (up to 50%). Basin hypsometry controls the magnitude of the basin response. The most sensitive basins are bottom-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at low elevations. The least sensitive basins are top-heavy, and have a greater proportion of their area at high elevations. Basins with similar proportional areas at high and low elevations fall in between the others in terms of sensitivity and other metrics. This work provides context for anticipating the impacts of ongoing hydrological change due to climate change, and provides guidance for both monitoring networks and distributed modeling efforts.</abstract><url hash="71bb9b75">G21-174001</url><doi>10.3389/frwa.2021.604275</doi><bibkey>Shea-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="175"><meta><booktitle>Hydrological Processes, Volume 35, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Stable isotopes of water reveal differences in plant – soil water relationships across northern environments</title><author><first>Doerthe</first><last>Tetzlaff</last></author><author><first>James</first><last>Buttle</last></author><author><first>Sean K.</first><last>Carey</last></author><author><first>Matthew J.</first><last>Kohn</last></author><author><first>Hjalmar</first><last>Laudon</last></author><author><first>James P.</first><last>McNamara</last></author><author><first>Aaron</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Matthias</first><last>Sprenger</last></author><author><first>Chris</first><last>Soulsby</last></author><abstract>We compared stable isotopes of water in plant stem (xylem) water and soil collected over a complete growing season from five well-known long-term study sites in northern/cold regions. These spanned a decreasing temperature gradient from Bruntland Burn (Scotland), Dorset (Canadian Shield), Dry Creek (USA), Krycklan (Sweden), to Wolf Creek (northern Canada). Xylem water was isotopically depleted compared to soil waters, most notably for deuterium. The degree to which potential soil water sources could explain the isotopic composition of xylem water was assessed quantitatively using overlapping polygons to enclose respective data sets when plotted in dual isotope space. At most sites isotopes in xylem water from angiosperms showed a strong overlap with soil water; this was not the case for gymnosperms. In most cases, xylem water composition on a given sampling day could be better explained if soil water composition was considered over longer antecedent periods spanning many months. Xylem water at most sites was usually most dissimilar to soil water in drier summer months, although sites differed in the sequence of change. Open questions remain on why a significant proportion of isotopically depleted water in plant xylem cannot be explained by soil water sources, particularly for gymnosperms. It is recommended that future research focuses on the potential for fractionation to affect water uptake at the soil-root interface, both through effects of exchange between the vapour and liquid phases of soil water and the effects of mycorrhizal interactions. Additionally, in cold regions, evaporation and diffusion of xylem water in winter may be an important process.</abstract><url hash="c907fc10">G21-175001</url><doi>10.1002/hyp.14023</doi><bibkey>Tetzlaff-2021-Stable</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="176"><meta><booktitle>Earth System Science Data, Volume 13, Issue 3</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Meteorological observations collected during the Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE), April–June 2019</title><author><first>Julie M.</first><last>Thériault</last></author><author><first>Stephen J.</first><last>Déry</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Hilary M.</first><last>Smith</last></author><author><first>Juris</first><last>Almonte</last></author><author><first>André</first><last>Bertoncini</last></author><author><first>Robert W.</first><last>Crawford</last></author><author><first>Aurélie</first><last>Desroches-Lapointe</last></author><author><first>Mathieu</first><last>Lachapelle</last></author><author><first>Zen</first><last>Mariani</last></author><author><first>Selina</first><last>Mitchell</last></author><author><first>Jeremy E.</first><last>Morris</last></author><author><first>Charlie</first><last>Hébert-Pinard</last></author><author><first>Peter</first><last>Rodriguez</last></author><author><first>Hadleigh D.</first><last>Thompson</last></author><abstract>Abstract. The continental divide along the spine of the Canadian Rockies in southwestern Canada is a critical headwater region for hydrological drainages to the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. Major flooding events are typically attributed to heavy precipitation on its eastern side due to upslope (easterly) flows. Precipitation can also occur on the western side of the divide when moisture originating from the Pacific Ocean encounters the west-facing slopes of the Canadian Rockies. Often, storms propagating across the divide result in significant precipitation on both sides. Meteorological data over this critical region are sparse, with few stations located at high elevations. Given the importance of all these types of events, the Storms and Precipitation Across the continental Divide Experiment (SPADE) was initiated to enhance our knowledge of the atmospheric processes leading to storms and precipitation on either side of the continental divide. This was accomplished by installing specialized meteorological instrumentation on both sides of the continental divide and carrying out manual observations during an intensive field campaign from 24 April–26 June 2019. On the eastern side, there were two field sites: (i) at Fortress Mountain Powerline (2076 m a.s.l.) and (ii) at Fortress Junction Service, located in a high-elevation valley (1580 m a.s.l.). On the western side, Nipika Mountain Resort, also located in a valley (1087 m a.s.l.), was chosen as a field site. Various meteorological instruments were deployed including two Doppler light detection and ranging instruments (lidars), three vertically pointing micro rain radars, and three optical disdrometers. The three main sites were nearly identically instrumented, and observers were on site at Fortress Mountain Powerline and Nipika Mountain Resort during precipitation events to take manual observations of precipitation type and microphotographs of solid particles. The objective of the field campaign was to gather high-temporal-frequency meteorological data and to compare the different conditions on either side of the divide to study the precipitation processes that can lead to catastrophic flooding in the region. Details on field sites, instrumentation used, and collection methods are discussed. Data from the study are publicly accessible from the Federated Research Data Repository at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0221 (Thériault et al., 2020). This dataset will be used to study atmospheric conditions associated with precipitation events documented simultaneously on either side of a continental divide. This paper also provides a sample of the data gathered during a precipitation event.</abstract><url hash="dbb253fe">G21-176001</url><pages>1233-1249</pages><doi>10.5194/essd-13-1233-2021</doi><bibkey>Thériault-2021-Meteorological</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="177"><meta><booktitle>Climate Dynamics, Volume 58, Issue 3-4</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Moisture budget analysis of extreme precipitation associated with different types of atmospheric rivers over western North America</title><author><first>Yaheng</first><last>Tan</last></author><author><first>Song</first><last>Yang</last></author><author><first>Francis</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Ziqian</first><last>Wang</last></author><author><first>Qiaohong</first><last>Sun</last></author><abstract /><url hash="630e349b">G21-177001</url><pages>793-809</pages><doi>10.1007/s00382-021-05933-3</doi><bibkey>Tan-2021-Moisture</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="178"><meta><booktitle>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Volume 25, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>Copernicus GmbH</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Summary and synthesis of Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) research in the interior of western Canada – Part 2:  Future change in cryosphere, vegetation, and hydrology</title><author><first>Chris M.</first><last>DeBeer</last></author><author><first>Howard S.</first><last>Wheater</last></author><author><first>John W.</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>Alan G.</first><last>Barr</last></author><author><first>Jennifer L.</first><last>Baltzer</last></author><author><first>Jill F.</first><last>Johnstone</last></author><author><first>Merritt R.</first><last>Turetsky</last></author><author><first>Ronald E.</first><last>Stewart</last></author><author><first>Masaki</first><last>Hayashi</last></author><author><first>Garth</first><last>van der Kamp</last></author><author><first>Shawn</first><last>Marshall</last></author><author><first>Elizabeth</first><last>Campbell</last></author><author><first>Philip</first><last>Marsh</last></author><author><first>Sean K.</first><last>Carey</last></author><author><first>William L.</first><last>Quinton</last></author><author><first>Yanping</first><last>Li</last></author><author><first>Saman</first><last>Razavi</last></author><author><first>Aaron</first><last>Berg</last></author><author><first>Jeffrey J.</first><last>McDonnell</last></author><author><first>Christopher</first><last>Spence</last></author><author><first>Warren D.</first><last>Helgason</last></author><author><first>Andrew M.</first><last>Ireson</last></author><author><first>T.

The interior of western Canada, like many similar cold mid- to high-latitude regions worldwide, is undergoing extensive and rapid climate and environmental change, which may accelerate in the coming decades. Understanding and predicting changes in coupled climate–land–hydrological systems are crucial to society yet limited by lack of understanding of changes in cold-region process responses and interactions, along with their representation in most current-generation land-surface and hydrological models. It is essential to consider the underlying processes and base predictive models on the proper physics, especially under conditions of non-stationarity where the past is no longer a reliable guide to the future and system trajectories can be unexpected. These challenges were forefront in the recently completed Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), which assembled and focused a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and prediction of change over the cold interior of western Canada. CCRN advanced knowledge of fundamental cold-region ecological and hydrological processes through observation and experimentation across a network of highly instrumented research basins and other sites. Significant efforts were made to improve the functionality and process representation, based on this improved understanding, within the fine-scale Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform and the large-scale Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire (MEC) – Surface and Hydrology (MESH) model. These models were, and continue to be, applied under past and projected future climates and under current and expected future land and vegetation cover configurations to diagnose historical change and predict possible future hydrological responses. This second of two articles synthesizes the nature and understanding of cold-region processes and Earth system responses to future climate, as advanced by CCRN. These include changing precipitation and moisture feedbacks to the atmosphere; altered snow regimes, changing balance of snowfall and rainfall, and glacier loss; vegetation responses to climate and the loss of ecosystem resilience to wildfire and disturbance; thawing permafrost and its influence on landscapes and hydrology; groundwater storage and cycling and its connections to surface water; and stream and river discharge as influenced by the various drivers of hydrological change. Collective insights, expert elicitation, and model application are used to provide a synthesis of this change over the CCRN region for the late 21st century.</abstract><url hash="3b6d24cd">G21-178001</url><pages>1849-1882</pages><doi>10.5194/hess-25-1849-2021</doi><bibkey>DeBeer-2021-Summary</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="179"><meta><booktitle>Environmental Research Letters, Volume 16, Issue 9</booktitle><publisher>IOP Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Changes in the frequency of global high mountain rain-on-snow events due to climate warming</title><author><first>J I</first><last>López-Moreno</last></author><author><first>J W</first><last>Pomeroy</last></author><author><first>E</first><last>Morán-Tejeda</last></author><author><first>J</first><last>Revuelto</last></author><author><first>F M</first><last>Navarro-Serrano</last></author><author><first>I</first><last>Vidaller</last></author><author><first>E</first><last>Alonso-González</last></author><abstract>Abstract Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can trigger severe floods in mountain regions. There is high uncertainty about how the frequency of ROS events (ROS) and associated floods will change as climate warms. Previous research has found considerable spatial variability in ROS responses to climate change. Detailed global assessments have not been conducted. Here, atmospheric reanalysis data was used to drive a physically based snow hydrology model to simulate the snowpack and the streamflow response to climate warming of a 5.25 km 2 virtual basin (VB) applied to different high mountain climates around the world. Results confirm that the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming is highly variable among sites, and also with different elevations, aspects and slopes in each basin. The hydrological model predicts a decrease in the frequency of ROS with warming in 30 out 40 of the VBs analyzed; the rest have increasing ROS. The dominant phase of precipitation, duration of snow cover and average temperature of each basin are the main factors that explain this variation in the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming. Within each basin, the largest decreases in ROS were predicted to be at lower elevations and on slopes with sunward aspects. Although the overall frequency of ROS drops, the hydrological importance of ROS is not expected to decline. Peak streamflows due to ROS are predicted to increase due to more rapid melting from enhanced energy inputs, and warmer snowpacks during future ROS.</abstract><url hash="83d143a8">G21-179001</url><pages>094021</pages><doi>10.1088/1748-9326/ac0dde</doi><bibkey>López-Moreno-2021-Changes</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="180"><meta><booktitle>Science of The Total Environment, Volume 752</booktitle><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Energy and carbon fluxes from an oil sands pit lake</title><author><first>M.

In 2012, Base Mine Lake (BML), was constructed with the aim of demonstrating technologies associated with lake reclamation in the region. This paper examines the first 6.5 years of lake-atmosphere energy and carbon exchange. Energetically, BML behaved similar to other northern lakes, storing large quantities of heat in the spring and releasing it in the fall as sensible and latent heat fluxes. At various times a hydrocarbon sheen formed on the lake, which may have suppressed evaporation. However, simple linear relationships failed to statistically quantify the impacts and more comprehensive modelling of the variability may be required. At daily scales, variability in evaporation was well explained by the product of vapour pressure deficit and wind speed as well as the available energy (R2 = 0.74), while sensible heat was explained by the product of wind speed and the difference in air and surface temperature as well as available energy (R2 = 0.85). Spring CH4 fluxes were high, particularly around ice melt, with a maximum flux of 3.3 g m-2 day-1. Otherwise fluxes were low, except during irregular periods. The peak flux of these periods occurred following ~58 h of continuously falling pressure, relating cyclone activity to these large periods of methane emissions. Annually, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were initially high, with median fluxes of 231 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 and 23 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 in 2014. However, the median fluxes reduced quickly and over the least three years of the study (2017 through 2019) the median fluxes declined to 36 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 and 10 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. Overall, BML behaves similar to other boreal lake ecosystems with above average carbon fluxes compared to other constructed reservoirs.</abstract><url hash="7c899bf3">G21-180001</url><pages>141966</pages><doi>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141966</doi><bibkey>Clark-2021-Energy</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="181"><meta><booktitle>Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, Volume 58, Issue 2</booktitle><publisher>Canadian Science Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Identifying groundwater discharge zones in the Central Mackenzie Valley using remotely sensed optical and thermal imagery</title><author><first>Brittney K.</first><last>Glass</last></author><author><first>David L.</first><last>Rudolph</last></author><author><first>Claude</first><last>Duguay</last></author><author><first>Andrew</first><last>Wicke</last></author><abstract>Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, and RapidEye-3 data sets were used to identify potential groundwater discharge zones, via icings, in the Central Mackenzie Valley (CMV) of the Northwest Territories. Given that this area is undergoing active shale oil exploration and climatic changes, identification of groundwater discharge zones is of great importance both for pinpointing potential contaminant transport pathways and for characterizing the hydrologic system. Following the work of Morse and Wolfe (2015), a series of image algorithms were applied to imagery for the entire CMV and for the Bogg Creek watershed (a sub watershed of the CMV) for selected years between 2004 and 2017. Icings were statistically examined for all of the selected years to determine whether a significant difference in their spatial occurrence existed. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in the spatial distribution of icings from year to year (α = 0.05), but that there were several places where icings were recurring. During the summer of 2018, these recurrent icings, which are expected to be spring sourced, were verified using a thermal camera aboard a helicopter, as well as in situ measurements of hydraulic gradient, groundwater geochemistry, and electroconductivity. Strong agreement was found between the mapped icings and summer field data, making them ideal field monitoring locations. Furthermore, identifying these discharge points remotely is expected to have drastically reduced the field efforts that would have been required to find them in situ. This work demonstrates the value of remote sensing methods for hydrogeological applications, particularly in remote northern locations.</abstract><url hash="c435fc96">G21-181001</url><pages>105-121</pages><doi>10.1139/cjes-2019-0169</doi><bibkey>Glass-2021-Identifying</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="182"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Climate, Volume 34, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>A Global, Continental, and Regional Analysis of Changes in Extreme Precipitation</title><author><first>Qiaohong</first><last>Sun</last></author><author><first>Xuebin</first><last>Zhang</last></author><author><first>Francis</first><last>Zwiers</last></author><author><first>Seth</first><last>Westra</last></author><author><first>Lisa V.</first><last>Alexander</last></author><abstract>Abstract This paper provides an updated analysis of observed changes in extreme precipitation using high-quality station data up to 2018. We examine changes in extreme precipitation represented by annual maxima of 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) precipitation accumulations at different spatial scales and attempt to address whether the signal in extreme precipitation has strengthened with several years of additional observations. Extreme precipitation has increased at about two-thirds of stations and the percentage of stations with significantly increasing trends is significantly larger than that can be expected by chance for the globe, continents including Asia, Europe, and North America, and regions including central North America, eastern North America, northern Central America, northern Europe, the Russian Far East, eastern central Asia, and East Asia. The percentage of stations with significantly decreasing trends is not different from that expected by chance. Fitting extreme precipitation to generalized extreme value distributions with global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate reaffirms the statistically significant connections between extreme precipitation and temperature. The global median sensitivity, percentage change in extreme precipitation per 1 K increase in GMST is 6.6% (5.1% to 8.2%; 5%–95% confidence interval) for Rx1day and is slightly smaller at 5.7% (5.0% to 8.0%) for Rx5day. The comparison of results based on observations ending in 2018 with those from data ending in 2000–09 shows a consistent median rate of increase, but a larger percentage of stations with statistically significant increasing trends, indicating an increase in the detectability of extreme precipitation intensification, likely due to the use of longer records.</abstract><url hash="d6805378">G21-182001</url><pages>243-258</pages><doi>10.1175/jcli-d-19-0892.1</doi><bibkey>Sun-2021-A</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="183"><meta><booktitle>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Volume 47, Issue 5</booktitle><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Mutation and Injection Framework: Evaluating Clone Detection Tools with Mutation Analysis</title><author><first>Jeffrey</first><last>Svajlenko</last></author><author><first>Chanchal K.</first><last>Roy</last></author><abstract>An abundant number of clone detection tools have been proposed in the literature due to the many applications and benefits of clone detection. However, there has been difficulty in the performance evaluation and comparison of these clone detectors. This is due to a lack of reliable benchmarks, and the manual efforts required to validate a large number of candidate clones. In particular, there has been a lack of a synthetic benchmark that can precisely and comprehensively measure clone-detection recall. In this paper, we present a mutation-analysis based benchmarking framework that can be used not only to evaluate the recall of clone detection tools for different types of clones but also for specific kinds of clone edits and without any manual efforts. The framework uses an editing taxonomy of clone synthesis for generating thousands of artificial clones, injects into code bases and automatically evaluates the subject clone detection tools following the mutation analysis approach. Additionally, the framework has features where custom clone pairs could also be used in the framework for evaluating the subject tools. This gives the opportunity of evaluating specialized tools for specialized contexts such as evaluating a tool’s capability for the detection of complex Type-4 clones or real world clones without writing complex mutation operators for them. We demonstrate this framework by evaluating the performance of ten modern clone detection tools across two clone granularities (function and block) and three programming languages (Java, C and C#). Furthermore, we provide a variant of the framework that can be used to evaluate specialized tools such as for large gaped clone detection. Our experiments demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of our Mutation and Injection Framework when comparing against the expected results of the corresponding tools, and widely used real-world benchmarks such as Bellon’s benchmark and BigCloneBench. We provide features so that most clone detection tools that report clones in the form of clone pairs (either in filename/line numbers or filename/tokens) could be evaluated using the framework.</abstract><url hash="6e3c341d">G21-183001</url><pages>1060-1087</pages><doi>10.1109/tse.2019.2912962</doi><bibkey>Svajlenko-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="184"><meta><booktitle>Soil and Water Research, Volume 16, Issue No. 2</booktitle><publisher>Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Best management practices for mitigating agricultural nutrient pollution in the Mun River Basin, Thailand</title><author><first>Arika</first><last>Bridhikitti</last></author><author><first>Thayukorn</first><last>Prabamroong</last></author><author><first>Liu</first><last>Gaohuan</last></author><author><first>Yu</first><last>Guo-An</last></author><abstract>The Mun River in NE Thailand is one of the significant tributaries of the Lower Mekong River. Its poor river quality has been reported and agricultural activities were claimed to be major causes. This study aims to assess the best management measures appropriately responsive to the nutrient pollution in the Mun River Basin’s agricultural ecosystems. The data used for the analysis were acquired from field measurements during the 2018 wet season via satellite retrieval and secondary data collection. Linkages between land-soil datasets and hydro-water quality datasets were assessed through a canonical correlation analysis. The results suggest possible conservation measures with crop yield improvement and fertiliser cost reduction in the western basin. For the southern basin, which exhibits high sediment loading, integrated conservation measures for soil loss reduction with in-stream flow deceleration should be chosen. In the eastern basin, woody buffer strips and check dams should be prioritised. Both nutrient and sediment pollution were experienced in the middle part of the Mun River Basin and applications of low-P manure with mineral NK are recommended. Nonetheless, other soil-water conservation measures can be optionally applied to enhance the effectiveness in the watershed management.</abstract><url hash="f3eb0ca4">G21-184001</url><pages>121-128</pages><doi>10.17221/101/2020-swr</doi><bibkey>Bridhikitti-2021-Best</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="185"><meta><booktitle>Proceedings of International Scientific and Practical Conference “Russia 2020 - a new reality: economy and society” (ISPCR 2020)</booktitle><publisher>Atlantis Press</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Encouraging Citizen Adoption of E-Governance – A Way to Reduce Corruption</title><author><first>A.V.</first><last>Averin</last></author><author><first>I.V.</first><last>Pogodina</last></author><author><first>V.S.</first><last>Manokhin</last></author><abstract /><url hash="4b576bc1">G21-185001</url><doi>10.2991/aebmr.k.210222.003</doi><bibkey>Averin-2021-Encouraging</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="186"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Climatology, Volume 41, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Extreme precipitation events in the Mediterranean: Spatiotemporal characteristics and connection to large‐scale atmospheric flow patterns</title><author><first>Nikolaos</first><last>Mastrantonas</last></author><author><first>Pedro</first><last>Herrera‐Lormendez</last></author><author><first>Linus</first><last>Magnusson</last></author><author><first>Florian</first><last>Pappenberger</last></author><author><first>Jörg</first><last>Matschullat</last></author><abstract>The Mediterranean is strongly affected by Extreme Precipitation Events (EPEs), sometimes leading to negative impacts on society, economy, and the environment. Understanding such natural hazards and their drivers is essential to mitigate related risks. Here, EPEs over the Mediterranean between 1979 and 2019 are analyzed, using ERA5 dataset from ECMWF. EPEs are determined based on the 99th percentile of the daily distribution (P99). The different EPE characteristics are assessed, based on seasonality and spatiotemporal dependencies. To better understand the connection to large-scale atmospheric flow patterns, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and subsequent K-means clustering are used to quantify the importance of weather regimes to EPE frequency. The analysis is performed for three different variables, depicting atmospheric variability in the lower and middle troposphere: Sea level pressure (SLP), temperature at 850 hPa (T850), and geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500). Results show a clear spatial division in EPEs occurrence, with winter (autumn) being the season of highest EPEs frequency for the eastern (western) Mediterranean. There is a high degree of temporal dependencies with 20% of the EPEs (median value of all studied grid-cells), occurring up to 1 week after a preceding P99 event at the same location. Local orography is a key modulator of the spatiotemporal connections and substantially enhances the probability of co-occurrence of EPEs even for distant locations. The clustering clearly demonstrates the prevalence of distinct synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions during the occurrence of EPEs for different locations within the region. Results indicate that clustering based on a combination of SLP and Z500 can increase the conditional probability of EPEs by more than three (3) times (median value for all grid cells) from the nominal probability of 1% for the P99 EPEs.</abstract><url hash="59e2c42f">G21-186001</url><pages>2710-2728</pages><doi>10.1002/joc.6985</doi><bibkey>Mastrantonas-2021-Extreme</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="187"><meta><booktitle>Multiscale Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation, Volume 19, Issue 1</booktitle><publisher>Society for Industrial &amp; Applied Mathematics (SIAM)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Multiscale Global Sensitivity Analysis for Stochastic Chemical Systems</title><author><first>Michael</first><last>Merritt</last></author><author><first>Alen</first><last>Alexanderian</last></author><author><first>Pierre A.</first><last>Gremaud</last></author><abstract>Sensitivity analysis is routinely performed on simplified surrogate models as the cost of such analysis on the original model may be prohibitive.

Data on in situ GHG fluxes from thawing permafrost OM are scarce and OM degradability is largely unknown, causing high uncertainties in the permafrost-carbon climate feedback. We combined in situ CO2 and methane flux measurements at an abrupt permafrost thaw feature with laboratory incubations and dynamic modeling to quantify annual CO2 release from thawing permafrost OM, estimate its in situ degradability and evaluate the explanatory power of incubation experiments. In July 2016 and 2019, CO2 fluxes ranged between 0.24 and 2.6 g CO2-C m−2 d−1. Methane fluxes were low, which coincided with the absence of active methanogens in the Pleistocene permafrost. CO2 fluxes were lower three years after initial thaw after normalizing these fluxes to thawed carbon, indicating the depletion of labile carbon. Higher CO2 fluxes from thawing Pleistocene permafrost than from Holocene permafrost indicate OM preservation for millennia and give evidence that microbial activity in the permafrost was not substantial. Short-term incubations overestimated in situ CO2 fluxes but underestimated methane fluxes. Two independent models simulated median annual CO2 fluxes of 160 and 184 g CO2-C m−2 from the thaw slump, which include 25%–31% CO2 emissions during winter. Annual CO2 fluxes represent 0.8% of the carbon pool thawed in the surface soil. Our results demonstrate the potential of abrupt thaw processes to transform the tundra from carbon neutral into a substantial GHG source.</abstract><url hash="b93db31c">G21-188001</url><doi>10.1029/2021jg006543</doi><bibkey>Knoblauch-2021-Carbon</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="189"><meta><booktitle>Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, Volume 34, Issue 4</booktitle><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>The Potential of Bioeconomic Innovations to Contribute to a Social-Ecological Transformation: A Case Study in the Livestock System</title><author><first>Jonathan</first><last>Friedrich</last></author><author><first>Ingrid</first><last>Bunker</last></author><author><first>Sandra</first><last>Uthes</last></author><author><first>Jana</first><last>Zscheischler</last></author><abstract>Abstract Environmental crises, which are consequences of resource-intensive lifestyles and are characterized to a large extent by both a changing climate and a loss of biodiversity, stress the urgent need for a global social-ecological transformation of the agro-food system. In this regard, the bioeconomy and bioeconomic innovations have frequently been seen as instrumental in addressing these grand challenges and contributing to more sustainable land use. To date, the question of how much bioeconomic innovations contribute to sustainability objectives remains unanswered. Against this background, we study four bioeconomic innovations using the case study of animal production and manure utilization in relation to their potential contributions to a social-ecological transformation. The analysis is based on the application of analytical categories derived from the literature that assess the normativity of these innovations and their implicit cultural changes. The results show that the innovations examined manifest existing thought styles and the incumbent socio-technical regime rather than contribute to a more fundamental transition. In this respect, we stress the importance of evolving alterative ideas in innovation design, applying more integrative approaches, such as embedding innovation processes into transdisciplinary processes, and developing adaptive and reflective governance approaches. In return, bioeconomic innovations should adjust towards the design mission of a social-ecological transformation and include a multitude of actors to discuss and harmonize contesting imaginaries and ethical concerns.</abstract><url hash="0181d479">G21-189001</url><doi>10.1007/s10806-021-09866-z</doi><bibkey>Friedrich-2021-The</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="190"><meta><booktitle>PLOS ONE, Volume 16, Issue 11</booktitle><publisher>Public Library of Science (PLoS)</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>A process-based assessment of landscape change and salmon habitat losses in the Chehalis River basin, USA</title><author><first>Timothy J.</first><last>Beechie</last></author><author><first>Caleb</first><last>Fogel</last></author><author><first>Colin</first><last>Nicol</last></author><author><first>Britta</first><last>Timpane-Padgham</last></author><abstract>Identifying necessary stream and watershed restoration actions requires quantifying natural potential habitat conditions to diagnose habitat change and evaluate restoration potential. We used three general methods of quantifying natural potential: historical maps and survey notes, contemporary reference sites, and models. Historical information was available only for the floodplain habitat analysis. We used contemporary reference sites to estimate natural potential habitat conditions for wood abundance, riparian shade, main channel length, and side channel length. For fine sediment, temperature, and beaver ponds we relied on models. We estimated a 90% loss of potential beaver pond area, 91% loss of side-channel length, and 92% loss or degradation of floodplain marshes and ponds. Spawning habitat area change due to wood loss ranged from -23% to -68% across subbasins. Other changes in habitat quantity or quality were smaller—either in magnitude or spatial extent—including rearing habitat areas, stream temperature, and accessible stream length. Historical floodplain habitat mapping provided the highest spatial resolution and certainty in locations and amounts of floodplain habitat lost or degraded, whereas use of the contemporary reference information provided less site specificity for wood abundance and side-channel length change. The models for fine sediment levels and beaver pond areas have the lowest reach-specific certainty, whereas the model of temperature change has higher certainty because it is based on a detailed riparian inventory. Despite uncertainties at the reach level, confidence in subbasin-level estimates of habitat change is moderate to high because accuracy increases as data are aggregated over multiple reaches. Our results show that the largest habitat losses were floodplain and beaver pond habitats, but use of these habitat change results in salmon life-cycle models can illustrate how the potential benefits of alternative habitat restoration actions varies among species with differing habitat preferences.</abstract><url hash="41e9b243">G21-190001</url><pages>e0258251</pages><doi>10.1371/journal.pone.0258251</doi><bibkey>Beechie-2021-A</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="191"><meta><booktitle>Water Science and Technology</booktitle><publisher>IWA Publishing</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Experimental study on infiltration pattern: opportunities for sustainable management in the Northern region of India</title><author><first>Vikram</first><last>Kumar</last></author><author><first>Barkha</first><last>Chaplot</last></author><author><first>Padam Jee</first><last>Omar</last></author><author><first>Shaktibala</first><last>S.</last></author><author><first>H.</first><last>Md.

A comprehensive understanding of the spatial water infiltration characteristics over the soil which is site-specific and more complex due to non-uniformity could enhance the agriculture water use efficiency and mitigate water-related issues. The present study deals with the measurement of field infiltration characteristics using a mini disc infiltrometer in all 24 blocks of Gaya districts, Bihar, which covers a wide spectrum of soil types. Results showed that the average cumulative infiltration rate (IR) for the study area varies between 0.38 and 2.20 cm/min with an average rate of 1.16 cm/min. The initial IR among all blocks was found to be high but decreased gradually with each successive reading. Moreover, the land use under forest cumulative IR was more than the cumulative IR for urban and grassland. Eight blocks (33.3%) have an IR more than the average infiltration of the area which is good for storing the water in the aquifer and suggested constructing a recharge structure. Further investigation revealed a small IR in the inundated area, because of the maximum soil water table. The ready-to-use map showing the IR for the district is prepared which could be used by any decision-taking during the high or low rainfall, understanding the hydrological process, development of any reference guide for farmers for increasing the agriculture productivity and soil-water management.</abstract><url hash="f955d526">G21-191001</url><doi>10.2166/wst.2021.171</doi><bibkey>Kumar-2021-Experimental</bibkey></paper></volume><volume id="192"><meta><booktitle>International Journal of Climatology, Volume 42, Issue 7</booktitle><publisher>Wiley</publisher><address /><year>2021</year></meta><paper id="1"><title>Evaluation of statistical downscaling methods for climate change projections over Spain: Future conditions with pseudo reality (transferability experiment)</title><author><first>Alfonso</first><last>Hernanz</last></author><author><first>Juan Andrés</first><last>García‐Valero</last></author><author><first>Marta</first><last>Domínguez</last></author><author><first>Ernesto</first><last>Rodríguez‐Camino</last></author><abstract>The Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) is responsible for the elaboration of downscaled climate projections over Spain to feed the Second National Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC-2) and this is the last of three papers aimed to evaluate and intercompare five empirical/statistical downscaling (ESD) methods developed at AEMET: (a) Analog, (b) Regression, (c) Artificial Neural Networks, (d) Support Vector Machines and (e) Kernel Ridge Regression, in order to decide which methods and under what configurations are more suitable for that purpose. Following the framework established by the EU COST Action VALUE, in this experiment we test the transferability of these methods to future climate conditions with the use of regional climate models (RCMs) as pseudo observations. We evaluate the marginal aspects of the distributions of daily maximum/minimum temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation, over mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands, analysed by season. For maximum/minimum temperatures all methods display certain transferability issues, being remarkable for Support Vector Machines and Kernel Ridge Regression. For precipitation all methods appear to suffer from transferability difficulties as well, although conclusions are not as clear as for temperature, probably due to the fact that precipitation does not present such a marked signal of change. This study has revealed how an analysis over a historical period is not enough to fully evaluate ESD methods, so we propose that some type of analysis of transferability should be added in a standard procedure of a complete evaluation.</abstract><url hash="ebe07ac8">G21-192001</url><pages>3987-4000</pages><doi>10.1002/joc.7464</doi><bibkey>Hernanz-2021-Evaluation</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
