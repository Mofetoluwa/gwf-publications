Distributions of the simulated snow cover and snow water equivalent (SWE) reflect the detailed geographical features.Due to global warming, the beginning of the snow-accumulating season (the end of the snow-melting season) will occur later (earlier) in most snow regions, and the snow cover will decrease except for very few exceptions. SWE will also decrease in wide areas, but over the cold regions (Siberia and the northern parts of North America), SWE will increase due to increases of snowfall in the coldest season.In both the change and the percentage change of the SWE, we can find that the detailed geographical features effect on them. In Japan, the SWE will decrease over the heavy snow areas. However, the percentage changes are relatively smaller over the colder areas.</abstract><url hash="619b80f9">G05-1001</url><pages>93-96</pages><doi>10.2151/sola.2005-025</doi><bibkey>Hosaka-2005-Changes</bibkey></paper></volume></collection>
